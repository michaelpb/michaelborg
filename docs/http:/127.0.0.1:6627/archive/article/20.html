<p>I've noticed I've written a total of 9 open source packages for the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot engine</a>! I'm pretty pleased with this number, nothing makes me happier than giving back to the world of free software. I created a page that I'll keep updated with links to all of the repos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../godot-packages/index.html">http://michaelb.org/godot-packages/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This includes both ones I've mentioned on my blog, and a few that are still too WIP to be much use to any one else. For the time being they only exist as git repos, eventually I may see how to integrate them into Godot's asset store. I'm also pleased to note that game development can be done in a quite modular fashion following similar practices to other software dev.</p>
<p>Here's a GIF of the most recent thing I've been working on... once finished I'll post a full post describing it's usage:</p>
