<section class="post-content">
<p>I'm about the opposite of a graphics expert, but I have discovered that by using Inkscape's built-in filters you can very quickly make some basic, initial assets for puzzle games, or UI elements for games of other genres. This is less a tutorial, more just to inspire other artistically-challenged people like me with what can be accomplished with the built-in filters.</p>
<p>First, if don't have Inkscape installed, you should do that now! It's free, and cross-platform, and <a href="../getting-started-with-linux-game-development/index.html">importantly for me</a>, native on Linux. <a href="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Filter_Effects">Inkscape's filter feature</a> is way, way more powerful than I'm using it here... but, baby-steps!</p>
<h3 id="heartpowerup">Heart powerup</h3>
<p>Here's an example of making a heart icon using the "Glowing Metal" filter:</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2017/02/inkscape_glowing_metal_filter.gif" alt="Glowing metal heart icon"></p>
<ol>
<li><p>First I made the icon in a flat way. For example you can use basic geometric shapes such as circles and squares, and then using "Path &gt; Combine" to merge them, or draw using the pen tool and a grid.</p></li>
<li><p>Then I tried out some of the filter presets until I got to one I liked, to be used as a heart power-up for a puzzle-game.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For an "unfilled" heart, I just got rid of the fill and just used a stroke on the original effect:</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2017/02/inkscape_glowing_metal_filter_empty.gif" alt="Glowing metal, unfilled heart icon"></p>
<h3 id="glasseffect">Glass effect</h3>
<p>Creating a transparent "glass dome" effect is also useful, great for UI for both puzzle games and others (such as RPGs):</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2017/02/inkscape_smart_jelly_glass_effect.gif" alt="Glass dome UI effect"></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make a semi-transparent, white shape</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the "Smart Jelly" filter</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That's all for now, I hope it's useful for someone out there!</p>
