<h1 class="title">Linux pro-audio: Trouble-shooting JACK on Ubuntu 16.04 (KXStudio repos)</h1>
<section class="post-content">
<p>To produce music for the games I'm writing, had to get set up for GNU/Linux pro-audio. I installed the KXStudio repos on a vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 install on a Lenovo T520, and ran into 4 issues before I had a comfortable set-up and audio functioning. Some of these may apply to you, so hopefully my info on how to solve them could help you out!</p>
<p><strong>In light of these issues and other paper-cuts, I'd highly recommend instead installing the KXStudio distro on a separate partition, which is what I ended up doing in the end.</strong> <a href="../getting-started-with-pro-audio-on-linux/index.html">Click here for my original post which talks a bit about that process.</a></p>
<h2 id="issue1usernotinaudioorrealtimegroup">Issue #1: User not in audio or realtime group</h2>
<p>My Issue: Cannot create a session in Ardour</p>
<p>Solution: Add your user to <code>realtime</code> and <code>audio</code> groups.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried to do was create a session in Ardour. It immediately failed and crashed, saying that it could not create a new project. The error message made me think it was file-permission related, but it actually had nothing to do with it: Between <a href="http://jackaudio.org/faq/">helpful JACK documentation</a> and reading old <a href="https://community.ardour.org/node/7237">Ardour forum threads</a>, I figured out that it can report this error when the user is not in the realtime and audio groups, which can be fixed as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo usermod -a -G realtime $USER  
sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER  
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>$USER</code> gets auto-substituted for your username.)</p>
<h2 id="issue2jackisnotstarted">Issue #2: JACK is not started</h2>
<p>My Issue: Started Claudio session manager, and it said it couldn't connect to JACK.</p>
<p>Solution: Start JACK, just type <code>jack_control --start</code></p>
<p>This is an obvious one, but for some reason I thought JACK would autostart by default with the KXStudio repos, which is not the case. Howwever, KXStudio does provide a few nicer ways of tarting JACK:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Cadence">Cadence</a> - this is what I use, it's a GUI control panel for monitoring and managing audio </li>
<li><a href="http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/">qjackctl</a> - popular older GUI solution </li>
<li>Ardour can start and manage it automatically.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="issue3pulseaudionotkillednomidi">Issue #3: Pulse audio not killed, no MIDI</h2>
<p>My Issue: Claudio starts, but it doesn't show hardware MIDI</p>
<p>Solution: For me, the issue was pulse audio was still running. Kill it <code>pulseaudio --kill</code></p>
<p>You'll probably want a more <a href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/7130/2">elegant solution</a> to disable it permanently.</p>
<h2 id="issue4jacksalsaoutputnothookeduptotheaudio">Issue #4: JACK's ALSA output not hooked up to the audio</h2>
<p>Issue: Everything seemed fine and I could route audio through JACK, but nothing came out of my speakers or headphones.</p>
<p>Solution: For some reason JACK wasn't hooked up to my hardware.</p>
<p>I personally solved it using the KXStudio JACK manager Cadence as such:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Cadence, click the "Configure" button </li>
<li>Now click "Driver" </li>
<li>Then click "ALSA" </li>
<li>Finally, look at the option Output Device and select the one that makes sense</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>My conclusion for pro-audio on Linux (and maybe in general on all platforms): <strong>keep a separate partition, hard-drive, OR computer with your pro-audio set-up, running a distribution dedicated to audio.</strong> This may sound like over-kill, but its actually less effort in the long-run.</p>
