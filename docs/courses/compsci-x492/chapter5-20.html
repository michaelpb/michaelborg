# Your new role

You job searched, you interviewed, you negotiated, you signed the contract,
and now you're hired. Welcome to your new job and the next step in what we hope
will be an exciting and rewarding career!

In this next section we'll discuss aspects of professionalism after
you've landed your first engineering role. Our aim here is to help you get a sense of
a few key strategies to promote success as you enter this exciting new chapter.
Looking forward, we'll talk about: (1) **Cultivating the skill of understanding
other's code,** (2) **using the support of your team**, (3) **maintaining
openness to working cross functionally,** (4) **Logging your accomplishments
and contributions** and finally (5) **remembering that asking questions is a
good thing**. Good luck!

## Cultivate the skill of understanding other's code

When you first take a developer role, it's likely that the majority of your initial
challenges will include just getting the darn thing up and running.
Don't be discouraged if you don't feel like you are contributing or pulling
your weight right away. This is normal. New hires always take time before they
start truly adding value to a company.

You'll be working in an existing code base to debug, discover and integrate
solutions. Cultivating a sense of how you can seamlessly integrate clean and
efficient code into someone else's work is a daunting task. In some cases
it'll come naturally, but in others, it will require taking time to study how
someone else on your team was thinking when they wrote what you're now viewing
(thank the programming gods for comments and documentation, right?)

Ultimately, your goal will be to **write code that looks exactly like everyone
else's**. There shouldn't be Jane's code and Alice's code, but instead just the
company's code or the project's code. Resist the urge to make stuff yours, and
you'll have an easier time during those dreaded code review moments.

## Use the support of your team

You’re no longer an island, job seeking all alone but now a part of a new team
and culture and you should seek to make the most of being on a team. A simple
way to do this is by leaning on those around you who have been assigned to
support you, or happen to sit near you, to help clarify the best ways to
achieve success in your new role. Many team leads think critically about
seating new employees and have likely placed you near someone with similar
function; if you're not aware of an arrangement like this then take a moment to
ask someone during orientation / your first few weeks.

## Be open to opportunities to work cross functionally

An exciting part of working at a startup or tech company is building new and
innovative solutions and many of these opportunities begin as projects.
Projects are also good opportunities to work with teams or individuals you
might not normally work with in your day-to-day operations. If you have the
bandwidth, look to take on opportunities like these. Not only do they benefit
your experience as a developer but also enrich your network and provide you
with a greater awareness of how your work aligns in the overall mission of the
organization.

## Log your accomplishments and contributions

Throughout your work experience, you'll make a number of contributions and
receive acknowledgments about your work; it’s really important to create a log
of these instances as they become handy during a promotion period or when
transitioning roles. Appropriate examples include a coworker giving a shoutout;
leading development on a new side project; or pushing a new feature. Any of
these, and plenty others, can go into a personal dropbox or drive folder to
eventually be added or references at a key moment.

## Asking questions is a good thing

Finally, we encourage you to do something that might feel a bit nerve inducing:
ask questions. When you're new in a role or career, it can feel daunting to ask
questions and you might even find yourself wondering if you're annoying others
by doing so. Trust us, you're not. Everyone on your team has at one point or
another been the newbie and very likely asked questions to help them feel more
equipped and comfortable in their job. Some might even share their experiences
when you reach out to them or perhaps a running document (i.e. wiki) with
helpful insights. In other cases, you might have the opportunity to create a
helpful doc or process to help others who come after you. Either way, it’s a
win-win situation for everyone and a great chance to get to know those around
you.

**REMEMBER:** It's their job to answer your questions. *ALWAYS* err on the side
of asking too many questions!

There you have it, helpful tips for promoting success in your first tech job.
Good luck and go forward in confidence!
