# Cover Letters

Now we'll discuss the cover letter portion of an application. Our
task here is to cover the basics on: (1) **what is a cover letter** and (2)
**how do you structure one?** Our aim here is to optimize your time and effort
while encouraging a clear and meaningful voice.

## What's a cover letter?

Usually accompanied by a \resumeNoSpace, the cover letter is an introductory
document designed to help convey a more personal snapshot of who you are as an
applicant. Specifically, it takes career and related \resume highlights and
points them out in a manner related to the company or role description. Cover
letters generally abide by the one page rule.^[1 single-sided page, 2ish
paragraphs, never more than 3] It's vital to keep it concise, as hiring
managers receive hundreds if not thousands of cover letters for a given role.^[

## Are they still relevant?

Cover letters are requested very often.  Some companies will
prefer them, some require them, and others never take the time to request.
Regardless, you don't want to find yourself completely avoiding a company
simply because they require a cover letter. Alternatively, it would be a shame
to allocate hours to a single document just to get rejected or never hear back.

So how do you ensure you're ready while saving time? We suggest using a
template to save time and effort.  The template can be a go-to doc, with
information already typed out and anywhere from prompts to a couple key work
examples pre-typed.  We don't advise using the exact same cover letter for
every application, but having a selection of pieces to assemble saves time, and
that time adds up quickly when you're applying for dozens or eventually
hundreds of positions.


## Structuring a cover letter

Now that we know what a cover letter entails, let's see how to structure it for
success.

The following is a reliable structure: *Greeting, hook / introduction, body,
and a close.*


- **Greeting** - The go-to greeting is "Dear Hiring Manager,". However, you can
    use tools like LinkedIn and AngelList, or your network, to discover who
    will specifically view your letter. This works well for SMBs, startups,
    and teams who share the recruiting point of contact but not every company
    you apply to fits this description. What then? Try one of these two options:

    - **Get as close as you can by addressing the dept** with "Dear Data
    Engineering hiring manager" *or*

    - **Play it safe** with "*(optional: Dear) Hiring Manager*"

- **Hook (introduction)** - Many of us learned the K-12 writing
    strategy of beginning with a "hook" or something to grab the reader's
    attention. Cover letters are a great place to dust off that strategy and
    use it as a way to keep them reading. The goal is to grab attention, which
    means it's okay to be creative with the way you do it. 
    It's possible a "*I'm interested in applying for your posted front end
    role.*" might get the benefit of the doubt but stack it against a jazzed-up
    introduction and it might influence the impression of the role’s hiring
    manager when viewing your \resume or listed achievements. Check out these
    examples:

    - **Mention a contact or mutual connection** - "Jessica D. Buggs is a
      mutual connection of ours from Blend and thought my problem solving
      skills would be a great fit for this team."

    - **Share an accomplishment** - "Formerly, at Yelp, I exceeded my sales
      quota 3 quarters straight by 33%..."

    - **Connect the position to your narrative** - "I'm super excited about
      what your company is doing to disrupt bio-lab work, as it reflects my
      own journey from..."

    - **Refer to a recent publication, milestone or product user experience** -
      "After reading yesterday's TechCrunch article covering the 4 Keys to
      eCommerce, I had to reach out immediately and beat the upcoming influx of
      \resumes that are sure to follow."

- **Body** - Now to the bulkiest part of your cover letter, the body.  Here
you'll address two key ideas:

    - **Make it clear why you'd want to work with this team and company** -
      This structure should come easier if you'd completed Milestone 2 on story
      and narrative. The aim here is expressing the most significant reasons
      this team, brand, service or product has personally influenced you.
      After stating your reason, substantiate it. Bonus points if you can tie
      it directly to the role you're pursuing *and* your own work
      accomplishments that you'll be discussing in the next paragraph.

    - **Make it clear why they should want to work with you** - This is your
      space to brag and help your Hiring Manager reader recognize your
      relevant, noteworthy accomplishments. What you write about is entirely up
      to how you and the given job description. If your strength is industry
      expertise, go for it; perhaps it's prior management experience-- great!
      Another approach can be highlighting your exceptional behavioral skills,
      especially in a team or client-oriented world. Whichever you choose, make
      it clear how you've succeeded in a similar manner to what’s being looked
      for in the role you're pursuing.

- **Closing** - Finally time to bring the cover letter to a close.  There
    are two key components to a good cover letter closing:

    - **Close with an actionable statement** - your closing sentence is a
    perfect opportunity to accomplish three things (1) communicate appreciation
    for the reader’s time while (2) reiterating enthusiasm and (3) fit for the
    role. Consider the following example: "thank you for your time, I'm excited
    to learn more about next steps and how my time biology background can
    further the mission of BioFuture."

    - **Use a formal valediction** such as "Sincerely" or "Best" or "Best
    regards" followed by your full professional name.
