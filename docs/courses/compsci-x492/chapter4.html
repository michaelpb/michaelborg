# Application process

Let's dive into the most anticipated aspects of the entire process:
Interviewing. In this section we'll (1) examine a typical application process (2)
look at the different types of pre-interview challenges you might face (3) talk
about general tips for screening interviews (4) go through general tips for the
on-site interviews (5) dive into common interview questions and how to answer
them, and finally (6) talk about problem solving for on-site "whiteboarding"
interviews.

While it's intimidating for your entire job hunt process to seemingly hang in
the balance in a few crucial key hours of inspection, with these tips from
veteran interviewers (and interviewees) you can go into the interview process
with confidence!

> **Tip:** Cheat-sheets are super useful for online or phone-based interviews.

## Big picture

For hiring for entry-level positions, many tech companies have the following
process:

1. **Application** --- You submit your \resume & application

2. **Challenge(s)** --- For entry-level positions, it's common to first
encounter either an *automated algorithm quiz* (a Hacker Rank-style coding
challenge, with automated grading), or a *take-home challenge* (a
"mini-project" to do in a given framework, and submit for human review via a
GitHub link or emailed zip file).

3. **Screen(s)** --- Phone screen interviews can take the form of *tech
screens* (done by an engineer), or behavioral or *recruiter screens* (typically done by recruiter or HR).

4. **Video Interviews / On-site(s)** --- Finally, the big day! Full video interviews
and/or on-sites can range from an hour to an entire day of interviews. They can be
behavioral, technical, or a mixture of both. Often, there can be two rounds, as the pool of candidates is
further reduced.

5. **Offer**

## Big picture tips

* **Go-to language:** Pick a programming language as your go-to. We recommend
  Python, but if you are mostly applying to front-end developer positions,
  JavaScript might be a good choice too. Ultimately choose the one that you are
  most comfortable with. (Rationale for Python: It is widely known, has a terse
  syntax that is easy to write by hand, along with powerful built-in language
  constructs such *sets* that come in handy in a lot of interview-style questions.)

* **Research the interviewer:** Always look at the title and/or LinkedIn of the
  person interviewing you. Are they an engineer? Be ready for potentially tough
  technical questions. Anything else? Probably going to be behavioral or
  screening questions.

* **Don't give up!** Give everything your best, and even if you don't succeed
  submit it anyway. Be ready to fail many times before you succeed.^[I've
  coached so many students who think they absolutely bomb a set of interviews
  or challenges, only to find out soon after that they actually knocked the
  socks off the interviewer. The reverse can be true sometimes also. As an
  interviewee, it can be very hard to know how well you are doing.]



## Pre-interview check-list

- **Interview type known** -- will it involve coding?

- **Company & product researched** --- know the company, and have some ideas on
their product.

- **Interviewer researched** --- you know their name & position.

- **Questions prepared** --- you have a question or two for the interviewer.

*For coding interviews:*

- **Brain "warmed up"** --- do challenges right up to the time you have to
  leave for the interview. You want to start "in the zone".

*For behavioral interviews:*

* **Mock-interview work-sheet "warmed up"** --- warm up by going through the
  mock-interview worksheet.

* **Technical story prepared** --- have a technical story picked out and ready
  to be told.

# Screening challenges

It's likely the first thing you will face is some sort of online test or
challenge. While they can be required for a variety of positions, it's most
common to encounter these for entry-level to mid-level positions, such as those
open to bootcamp graduates.^[Because higher-level hires tend to cost more, the
evaluation process is usually more hands-on and less automated.]

## Automated tests

*Automated online coding tests* are how 100s of applicants can be weeded-out so
that only dozens remain.  They'll often send a link to a third-party site or a
custom site, such as Hacker Rank. Often, on that site is a button that will
"reveal" the challenge and give you a time-limit for giving an answer or
solving it in a programming language of your choice.

### Tips

> See 6.1 for more general resources & tips on preparing for coding challenges.

- Get your cheatsheets handy, have Google tabs open, be as prepared as
  possible. This is a race against the clock to assemble the best possible
  solutions to each challenge.

- As with in-person interviews, the only way to "lose" fully is by giving up
  or not trying. Partial credit is good too, so attempt everything.

- Start "in the zone": Warm up your brain before you click the "Start" button
  by doing similar online challenges.


## Take-home challenges

Another option for weeding out candidates for entry-level and intermediate
level positions --- sometimes used in the place of or in conjunction to the
automated quizzes --- is a take-home coding challenge. This is often done in a
specified framework (such as React.js or Django). They often say "take as much
time as you want", but clearly you shouldn't for a few reasons: (1) you are
competing against other applicants, and (2) your time is valuable, and you need
time for applying for other positions, too.

These challenges can be very frustrating due to how time consuming they are,
and are especially asymmetric in time consumption. The company can give out
dozens of these, spending possibly a total of 100s of hours of applicants time,
only to spend an hour looking over them and out of that choose one or a few
applicants to move forward. That being said, don't skip it: Responsible
companies won't give this challenge to a candidate they aren't serious about.

### Tips

* Set a time-limit. "Clock in" and "clock out" as though you were contracting.
  Your time-limit should be based on your free-time and a judgment of both how
  serious you think the company is taking your candidacy, and how much you like
  this position.^[When you are done, you can even feel free to report back to
  them how much time you spent on it.]
    - Don't do it all at once --- if, for example, you decide that it's worth
      it to spend 8 hours on one of these, space it out over a few days.

* Code quality is paramount: Write good, clean, commented code.
    - Attempt to write "self-documenting code"
    - Sprinkle in comments. There is *definitely* such a thing as too many
      comments: Comments should be added only where the code itself is
      difficult or impossible to decipher.^[That said, for a take-home
      challenge, if you aren't sure what's the right amount, it's probably
      better to err (slightly) on the side of too many comments.]
    - Possibly document all public function signatures --- this depends on
      whatever is standard for the language or framework you are using

* Code neatness is extremely important too: Use a "linter" to ensure your code
  follows the indentation, whitespace, and naming conventions of the language
  you are using.

* Ask questions! If the requirements aren't clear, clarify them before you
  start.



# Interviewing screens


## What is an interviewing screen

Interviewing screens are a part of every single technical interviewing process.
This stage helps companies filter through their "top of funnel" or applicant
pool to ensure the company's hiring team is efficiently allocating bandwidth to
the most promising applicants. Companies go about this process differently
using coding screens, video conversations, generic problem solving questions or
pair programming as a means of teasing out skills. But before companies come to
this phase of technical screening, it's helpful to know how a company decided
to invite a given candidate for a technical screen --- cue the initial (or
recruiter) screen.^[See Atlassian's approach: [atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/coding-challenges`](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/coding-challenges)]

Initial interviewing screens are also known as recruiter screens because
recruiters tend to be the next step following an outreach attempt, referral or
application. At this phase, recruiters are doing a "get to know you" phone call
to get a sense of your story, communication abilities, culture fit and perhaps
key accomplishments that help provide the recruiter with the confidence needed
to pass you onto the next stage in the hiring process. Successful candidates
will have a succinct career journey that’s consistent with the given resume
along with a few concrete stories related to project or career success. The
better your story can align with the role in question or the recruiter's
experience, the higher likelihood the recruiter will feel confident about
passing on your application.

Once you pass the initial screen, a technical screen tends to follow. This
phase is geared at filtering out your basic coding skills. Depending on the
company or role needs, technical screens can be pretty rigorous or simply a
technical bar to see if you really can code. Either way, this phase is one that
might be the basis for subsequent conversation in the interview process so try
your best to prepare and don't be afraid to ask your recruiter what to expect
in a technical challenge.

## Strategies for success in an interviewing screen

Interviewing is a solo sport but it doesn't mean there aren't resources and
avenues for support that don't exist. We hope to point you to a few of them
that you might find helpful:

- [*Glassdoor (glassdoor.com)*](http://glassdoor.com) - though not a technical
  hub, reviews on this site can help provide insight into what to expect when
  interviewing with a given company.

- [*Whiteboard.io (whiteboard.io)*](https://www.whiteboard.io/) - a technical
  interview prep program providing feedback, support and community.

- [*Stack exchange*](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/) - an online
  community where you can provide experiences, thoughts and interviewing
  questions on a forum.


- *The company's career site* - more and more companies are sharing how they
  differentiate themselves in an interview process and what to expect.
  Definitely worth a look for each company!


Given these insights, be sure to take time to explore and see what may work
best for your success.


# Interviewing on-sites

## What's an onsite interview

Onsite interviews are the holy grail of the interview process. If you've gotten
to this point, pat yourself on the back. Here, it's safe to say most companies
are committed to making things work out since the investment involved in an
onsite interview is usually pretty significant. Typically onsites entail a full
panel of interviewers including a hiring manager, peers, and your potential
manager.

This aim here is to see how you interact with a variety of colleagues and also
gather data points from several angles; though approaches vary, be prepared to
demonstrate technical skills, problem solving skills, communication skills and
interpersonal skills. Interviews always include both technical and
non-technical components and each interviewer will likely ask you about your
career journey and also provide time for you to ask them a few questions about
the team, role or company.

## Tips and resources for success

Most interviews bear similarity but few interviews are like that first, full
day onsite interviews. It's a time where breaks are short and you’re constantly
wondering how you’re being perceived. Despite these challenges, it's an
exciting experience and opportunity to gain the most accurate snapshot into who
you'll be working with and what you'll be working on in this new role. The
following are tips to keep in mind when preparing for and going through an
onsite interview:

- *Get the 411 from your recruiter* - As soon as you know an onsite interview
  is on the horizon, ask your recruiter to provide a snapshot of the day,
  including the structure of interviews and who you'll be meeting with.  These
  crucial insights can help you prepare for a whiteboard interview as opposed
  to pair-programming or give you the chance to LinkedIn research your
  interviewer.

- *Know your technical strengths* - In most cases it's better to know what
  you’re good at and focus on that as opposed to trying to cram new information
  the night before an on-site. If you can solve a problem in one manner or have
  more syntax familiarity in a given language, lean in to that strength.

- *Have your story down* - Know yourself. When giving your story, it's likely
  your interviewer has your \resume right in front of them. Make sure what
  you're sharing is consistent with what you wrote. Moreover, it's fair game to
  share the same stories with different interviewers, just consider emphasizing
  different points to give a well rounded vision of who you are.

- *Make sure you're comfortable* - a big key here is not being afraid to ask
  for (or bring) what you might need. Whether that's a water bottle, small
  granola bar, or asking for a bathroom break between interviews. Make sure
  you can be the best, most comfortable you. It will work in your favor.

- *Pseudo code is your friend* - When stepping up to a whiteboard or solving a
  problem, take your time and breath. Ask your interviewer if it's okay to
  pseudo code your problems or assumptions in a certain corner of the board or
  before writing your actual answer. Almost in every situation it is okay and
  might save you from making a regrettable logical leap when actually solving
  the problem.

- *Problem solve out-loud* - Finally, remember that no one can read minds.
  That means, whatever your interviewer can comment about your problem solving
  skills is completely dependent on your writing or communicating the thought
  process behind your solution. Interviewers want to know how you think; make
  sure to give them a clear picture of that.

# Interview questions & tips

To prepare for an interview, it's often good to have a "mock-interview" with
yourself. While it may seem strange, preparing for certain questions can
improve your confidence when you actually get asked them.

## Mock interview worksheet

1. For each question, answer on a separate sheet of paper --- or type up
answers, or answer verbally into a recording, so you can review your answer.
Imagine you are replying to each of several interviewers while interviewing
with an engineer at your favorite social network. Remember to answer
differently based on the person interviewing you!

2. When you are done, look at the "tips" at the end. "Grade" yourself based on
these tips.

3. With these tips in mind, try re-answering all the questions, or revising
your existing answer.

4. Practice saying out-loud your "second-draft" answers. It's important not to
memorize anything and sound rehearsed: Memorized answers that sound "too good"
could look bad in an interview. Instead, practice conversationally chatting
about it. Think about how you might "go into" these answers from other
questions that may not be covered here.

### Repeat mock interviews

**If you have time, try for as many other combinations as you can:**^[E.g.
Backend Engineer at Music sharing site. Product manager at real-estate site.
etc]

* Interviewers: *Backend Engineer*, *Designer*, *HR manager*, *Product manager*

* Companies: *Popular social media network*, *Real-estate listings website*,
  *Enterprise HR software company*, *Music sharing site*

## Tips

These are the "answers" or tips for these common interview questions.

* **Describe a technical challenge and how you overcame it.** --- This question
  is listed first because it's very often asked. Building a good *technical
  challenge narrative* is crucial to answering this question. See the
  "Technical challenge narrative" guide further on for in-depth tips on this
  one.

* **Can you tell me a bit about what you were doing at [your previous
  position]?** --- This can be answered in a similar way to the previews
  question, except you should be much "bigger picture." Instead of attempting
  to impress by describing a single story, you are giving the birds-eye view of
  all the things you've worked on, but ready to dive in about any particular
  detail. Sometimes this question is the lead-up to the previous question.
  Most of the advice contained in the "technical challenge narrative" below
  applies to this too.

* **Why did you choose *[technology / framework]* for the project *[previous
  project or position]*?** --- This is to ensure you picked languages and
  frameworks based on what solves the task, not based on what is "cool", or
  simply based on the fact that it's all you know (which could be true, also).
  Good answers will explain the strengths of the framework or language you
  chose in conjunction to the project you worked on, possibly a teamwork
  element or the decision making process you used with your team, and possibly
  mention others considered and why you ultimately discarded them.


* **Do you use our product? If so, what do you like about it? Dislike about
  it?** --- For consumer facing products, it helps to actually try out the
  product before the interview. It's okay to say you aren't super familiar, but
  even just messing around with it for just an hour shows that you care about
  the company and is an important part of pre-interview research.


* **At our company, we are always facing challenges scaling to accomidate new
  users. What approaches or considerations might you think about along these
  lines?** --- Consider who is asking this question: Backend Engineers, DevOps,
  or full stack folks are probably interested in hearing you talk about scaling
  from a server perspective. Frontend Engineers, Designers, and Product
  Managers might want you to address graphical / UX limitations (e.g. having to
  add a search feature because the amount of content is much bigger). Business
  or sales might want to hear some basic business scaling issues: Who would you
  have to hire to allow such an expansion?


* **If you could only pick one, what new feature would you add to our
  website?** --- Similar to the "have you used our product" question, this one
  gets asked a lot. Always go into an interview prepared to answer this
  question. For engineers interviewers, feel free to dive into speculation of
  how you might develop it, or what limitations might be in play. For sales,
  marketing, or more business-oriented interviewers ("suits"), motivate it with
  how that might improve the product from their perspective (e.g. increase
  "conversion rate" or decrease drop-off).

* **For that feature you mentioned, how would you test it to make sure it
  worked?** -- Even for non-QA positions, they'll want you to have some basic
  testing sensibilities. Think about normal usage, edge cases or corner cases,
  about unusual usage of large or small number of users using it, and so on. If
  the person asking is an engineer, feel free to talk about automated testing
  frameworks, unit tests, end-to-end tests, and so on. *You will always "win
  points" by saying that you're a big fan of automated testing.*


## Technical challenge narrative 


* **The question:** Can you describe a time you faced a technical challenge and
  how you overcame it?

* **The goal:** You want to prove that you'd be a valuable addition to the
  team. The interviewer will be evaluating your answer, picturing you as a
  member of their team, thinking if based on your answer you'd be good at
  contributing and solving the sort of problems they are facing or will be
  facing.

* A good story will involve the following elements:
    1. A tough or intriguing problem
    2. Teamwork and communication
    3. Your process of coming up with a solution (in conjunction with the team)
    4. Final success, and positive results

* A *great* story will involve one or more of the following:
    - Causing the interviewer to be engaged, and curious to learn more
      (earnestly asking questions)
    - Solving a problem in a similar domain of the company (e.g. if it's a
      retail company, perhaps do a about credit card payment
    - Generally being "outside" the knowledge of the interviewer --- e.g. if
      you describe struggling for a time with a problem that the interviewer
      solves daily, that's less impressive, but if you describe struggling with a
      problem that the interviewer has never even faced, that is a lot more
      interesting.
    - Solving a problem the interviewer's team is currently strugggling with.
      This is hitting the jackpot, since it's essentially saying: "Hey, hire me
      and I'll solve that issue you are facing right now."


### Technical challenge tips

* **Think of unique challenges.** No one wants to hear about how you messed up
  that Git merge, since it happens to everyone. Think of times you wrestled
  down buggy or poorly documented APIs. Think of problems that strayed way
  outside the collective knowledge of tutorials or Stack Overflow.

* **Prepare a couple stories.** Emphasize different technologies or types of
  challenges, and pick one based on which company you are chatting with.

* **Take note of who is asking.** Engineers want to hear how you applied your
  smarts to fix the problem. "Suits" want to hear about business results (e.g.
  increased clicks or conversions, increased value, didn't waste time). Both
  want to hear solid communication.

* **Go deep as you can.** Don't give a surface level explanation. Part of the
  purpose of this question is to ensure you aren't faking the fact you know the
  stuff on your resume. Be specific instead of being vague.

* **It's okay to give a "Hollywood" version.** Much like Hollywood biographies
  "clean up" the story to make an easier narrative, It's okay to smooth over
  your story, or maybe weave together a couple of challenges you faced that in
  fact were distinct, to make the story easier to tell and demonstrate your
  candidacy.  Of course never lie about your story or anything --- both for
  ethical reasons, and because the interviewer will probably notice --- but
  they aren't asking for every boring detail.

## More questions

You may also want to repeat this style of practice, with the "standard littany"
of behavioral interview questions:

- **Why do you want to work here?** --- Good reasons might include passion
  about the industry, company culture, excitement about the tech stack used,
  curiosity about the problems they are facing.

- **Out of all the other candidates, why should we hire you?** --- Speak to the
  particular combination of skills and life experience that makes you, you!

- **What are your biggest strengths?** --- Pick one (or two max) strengths to
  emphasize.^[E.g. Creative solutions to tough problems, perseverence, hard
  worker, leadership skills, agile communicator etc]

- **What are your biggest weaknesses?** --- Resist the temptation of answering
  "working too hard". Instead pick a real weakness, one that isn't a complete
  show-stopper, but shows honesty and ability for self-critique. Also, share
  what you are doing to improve in this respect.^[E.g. "I sometimes don't
  clarify requirements well enough before starting work. I'm really trying to
  get better at this, however."]

- **Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10 years?** --- A good way to answer
  this is simply think of a more advanced version of the position you are
  applying to. That might involve managerial duties, or it might involve a more
  specialized position based on what you are interested in (e.g. AI, Data
  Science, Lead Product Designer, etc.)

- **Tell me about a time you disagreed with a decision. What did you do?** ---
  The goal of this question is to see if you can "gracefully" admit you are
  wrong, or go along with a majority opinion. Tell a story from your work or
  project experience about a time where you maybe were on the wrong track but
  took criticism well.

- **What questions do you have for me?** --- *Always* come prepared with a few
  questions. If you are caught off guard, then just ask a few usual ones: "How
  long have you worked here? What was the biggest surprise you had about
  working here?" etc.



# "Whiteboarding" interviews

Ah, the dreaded whiteboarding interview! Chances are, if you are applying to
any sort of coding or engineering role, one or more of your on-sites will be a
"whiteboarding" interview. This can be done in a meeting room with a
whiteboard, or, more frequently with a piece of paper, or at a computer with an
editor, often with syntax highlighting turned off.

## Preparation

The best way to prepare for a whiteboarding interview is daily practice. These
sorts of challenges are different than "normal" programming, but instead are
contrived, puzzle-like questions that are intended to test logical thinking.

## Polya's 4 Step Process

The rest of this Milestone will be devoted to the classic math and computer
science problem solving framework known as *Polya's 4-Step Process*.  While
some of the advice might seem obvious, it's still a very useful framework for
approaching tough coding challenges.

### The Four Steps

#### Step 1: Understand the problem

* What are you asked to find or show?

* Can you restate the problem in your own words?

* Can you think of a picture or a diagram that might help you understand the
  problem?

* Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?

* Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?

* Do you need to ask a question to get more information?


#### Step 2: Devise a plan

Translate into clear terms, variables, data

* Guess and check

* Make an orderly list

* Eliminate possibilities

* Use symmetry

* Consider special cases

* Use direct reasoning

* Solve an equation

* Look for a pattern

* Draw a picture

* Solve a simpler problem

* Use a model

* Work backward

* Use a formula

* Be creative

Applying these rules to devise a plan takes your own skill and judgment.


#### Step 3: Carry out the plan

"Persist with the plan that you have chosen. If it continues not to work,
discard it and choose another. Don't be misled; this is how mathematics is
done, even by professionals."

#### Step 4: Verify, review, and reflect

"Much can be gained by taking the time to reflect and look back at what you
have done, what worked and what didn't. Doing this will enable you to predict
what strategy to use to solve future problems, if these relate to the original
problem."
