# "Whiteboard" interviews

Ah, the dreaded whiteboard interview! Chances are, if you are applying to
any sort of coding or engineering role, one or more of your on-sites or video calls
will be a "whiteboard" interview. This can be done in a meeting room with a
whiteboard, or, more frequently with a piece of paper, or at a computer with an
editor, often with syntax highlighting turned off.

## Preparation

The best way to prepare for a whiteboarding interview is daily practice. These
sorts of challenges are different than "normal" programming, but instead are
contrived, puzzle-like questions that are intended to test logical thinking.

## Polya's 4 Step Process

The rest of this chapter will be devoted to the classic math and computer
science problem solving framework known as *Polya's 4-Step Process*.  While
some of the advice might seem obvious, it's still a very useful framework for
approaching tough coding challenges.

### The Four Steps

#### Step 1: Understand the problem

* What are you asked to find or show?

* Can you restate the problem in your own words?

* Can you think of a picture or a diagram that might help you understand the
  problem?

* Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?

* Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?

* Do you need to ask a question to get more information?


#### Step 2: Devise a plan

Translate into clear terms, variables, data

* Guess and check

* Make an orderly list

* Eliminate possibilities

* Use symmetry

* Consider special cases

* Use direct reasoning

* Solve an equation

* Look for a pattern

* Draw a picture

* Solve a simpler problem

* Use a model

* Work backward

* Use a formula

* Be creative

Applying these rules to devise a plan takes your own skill and judgment.


#### Step 3: Carry out the plan

"Persist with the plan that you have chosen. If it continues not to work,
discard it and choose another. Don't be misled; this is how mathematics is
done, even by professionals."

#### Step 4: Verify, review, and reflect

"Much can be gained by taking the time to reflect and look back at what you
have done, what worked and what didn't. Doing this will enable you to predict
what strategy to use to solve future problems, if these relate to the original
problem."
