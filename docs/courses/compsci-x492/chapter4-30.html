# On-Sites and Video Interviews


Many interview processes have on-site interviews, where you go to the company or HQ
and physically interview. For fully remote or some hybrid positions, this stage might
be replaced with a gauntlet of video interviews, over Zoom or similar software.

Typically these both serve the same purpose: A final vetting process for the 
candidate. The approaches to both are pretty similar, since they are about evaluating
your final candidacy and ensuring you and the company both fully understand and
are able to do the new employment you are about to begin.


## What's an onsite interview

Onsite interviews -- as well as longer video interviews, for fully remote positions --
are the holy grail of the interview process. If you've gotten
to this point, pat yourself on the back. Here, it's safe to say most companies
are committed to making things work out since the investment involved in an
onsite or long video interview is usually pretty significant. Typically, they entail a full
panel of interviewers including a hiring manager, peers, and your potential
manager.

This aim here is to see how you interact with a variety of colleagues and also
gather data points from several angles; though approaches vary, be prepared to
demonstrate technical skills, problem solving skills, communication skills and
interpersonal skills. Interviews always include both technical and
non-technical components and each interviewer will likely ask you about your
career journey and also provide time for you to ask them a few questions about
the team, role or company.

## Tips and resources for success

Most interviews bear similarity but few interviews are like that first, full
day onsite interviews. It's a time where breaks are short and you’re constantly
wondering how you’re being perceived. Despite these challenges, it's an
exciting experience and opportunity to gain the most accurate snapshot into who
you'll be working with and what you'll be working on in this new role. The
following are tips to keep in mind when preparing for and going through an
onsite/video interview:

- *Get the 411 from your recruiter* - As soon as you know an onsite interview
  is on the horizon, ask your recruiter to provide a snapshot of the day,
  including the structure of interviews and who you'll be meeting with.  These
  crucial insights can help you prepare for a whiteboard interview as opposed
  to pair-programming or give you the chance to LinkedIn research your
  interviewer.

- *Know your technical strengths* - In most cases it's better to know what
  you’re good at and focus on that as opposed to trying to cram new information
  the night before an on-site or big interview. If you can solve a problem in one manner or have
  more syntax familiarity in a given language, lean in to that strength.

- *Have your story down* - Know yourself. When giving your story, it's likely
  your interviewer has your \resume right in front of them. Make sure what
  you're sharing is consistent with what you wrote. Moreover, it's fair game to
  share the same stories with different interviewers, just consider emphasizing
  different points to give a well rounded vision of who you are.

- *Be professional (and comfortable!)* - If at home in a video call, dress professional,
  but comfortable, and ensure you have a quality, professional-looking background.
  For either, a big key here is not being afraid to ask for (or bring) what you might
  need: Whether that's a water bottle, small
  granola bar, or taking a bathroom break between interviews. Make sure
  you can be the best, most comfortable you. It will work in your favor.

- *Pseudo code is your friend* - When stepping up to a whiteboard or solving a
  problem, take your time and breath. Ask your interviewer if it's okay to
  pseudo code your problems or assumptions in a certain corner of the board or
  before writing your actual answer. Almost in every situation it is okay and
  might save you from making a regrettable logical leap when actually solving
  the problem.

- *Problem solve out-loud* - Finally, remember that no one can read minds.
  That means, whatever your interviewer can comment about your problem solving
  skills is completely dependent on your writing or communicating the thought
  process behind your solution. Interviewers want to know how you think; make
  sure to give them a clear picture of that.
