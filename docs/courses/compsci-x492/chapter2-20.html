## Creating Job-Search Profiles

Now you try! This is a space for you to more intentionally direct your
job search. By filling out your own job-search profiles, you can more
clearly articulate your preferences and effectively use tools like [the
Angel.co job search (angel.co/jobs)](https://angel.co/jobs).



### Examples


```
- #1
Company Size: 11-50, 51-200
Company Industry: FinTech
Role Type: Back End, Full Stack
Employment Type: FTE
Example companies: Robinhood, Coinbase
```

```
- #2
Company Size: 201-1,000
Company Industry: FinTech
Role Type: Front End, Full Stack
Employment Type: FTE, Contract
Example companies: Credit Karma, Stripe
```


### Now you try

Try copying and pasting the following into your job search journal:

```
Company Size:
Company Industry:
Company Role:
Role Type:
Example companies:

## Asking the right questoins

Once you have developed a list of profiles, you'll want to ask yourself some questions on these profiles. To get you 
started, here are 7 questions to ask:

1. Which profiles might have higher salary, based on your research?
2. Which ones might fit your current skill level the best?
3. Which might offer more opportunity for advancement?
4. Which profile might be fastest to get?
5. Which industries do you want to work in, or find interesting?
6. Which industries are closest to your prior jobs or employment?
7. Which industry is the most stable in today's economy?

You might have some specific other questions or annotations that are specific
to your job hunt: Remember, not every job hunt or career change is the same,
so definitely give thought to what you want out of your next job - both from a personal
or life-satisfaction angle, but also from practical concerns, ranging from salary, to 
opportunity for advancement.

If you are brand new in your tech career, you may have to expand your job
search beyond this ideal profile. This includes looking for more junior level
positions, and also adjusting your search (and expectations) to the industry
demands of the job market that you are searching for. This might also include
considering life or financial constraints: E.g. You may not have the luxury of holding out
for the exact, perfect position, if you need to start collecting paychecks
right now to pay rent. As an example, if your ideal position is a Backend
Engineer, you might want to start as a Jr Frontend Engineer or even a Developer
Support Engineer, then once you get up-to-speed at your new company, you could
seek an internal title change.
