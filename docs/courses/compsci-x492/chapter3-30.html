In this section, we dive deeper into two distinct Outreach Strategies.
Next section we'll be following up with some useful templates.


## Informational Interviewing

Here we'll discuss a fun, low-stress strategy to help your networking efforts:
informational interviewing. During this section we'll discuss: (1) **what is
informational interviewing** (2) and **strategies to connect with
interviewees.** Our aim here is open your eyes to another new approach to job
hunting and networking. Good luck!

### What is informational interviewing?

Informational interviewing is a separate approach to networking and job hunting
prioritizing first-hand insights and experiences from company employees as
opposed to just publicly available information. Specifically, an interested job
seeker can gain advice on the role in question, industry, and/or the company
culture of a potential new place of work. As you might imagine, this sort of
experience can be really valuable usually in one of three ways: first, as an
interested candidate, you can network your way into the job process with
potential advocates. Second, the opportunity to clarify whether or not this is
a potential fit just became tremendously easier *without* beginning
the interview process. Third, with insights gained, you can learn how to speak
the language of your interviewing team.

### Strategies to connect with interviewees

This section is two-fold. First, we'll cover strategies to find interviewees
and then we'll discuss ways to approach asking questions, so you can
effectively connect during the interview session. When seeking new
connections, you'll use similar strategies outlined in earlier sections. As a
quick refresher, try some of the following:

- *LinkedIn* - LinkedIn is *the* career hub where users expect to receive
  invitations or messages from professional acquaintances. The key here is
  having a good reason-- which informational interviewing definitely falls into
  that category. Try strategies of following the person and comment on posts;
  from there, you can naturally mention your connection and make an ask for a
  quick call.

- *Company careers page* - Careers pages provide really valuable insights that
  a company is proud to publish for all potential new teammates to see.  Here's
  a great place to find insights and then define what isn’t listed that you
  might want to know.

- *Tech news* (i.e. Medium, Tech Crunch, company reports) - these posts tend to
  cite a team or author and are great opportunities to engage with relevant,
  time stamped material. You can engage via the publication or use social media
  to elevate it and then go from there.

Remember: when reaching out, make it clear you'd like to learn from them about
their experiences in a specific role or at a specific company. Doing this tends
to help the potential interviewee understand where you're coming from and
reaffirm the need to just show up versus prepare to do this, that and the other
on your behalf.

Now that you've gone about making connections, let's talk about a few ways to
ensure success when in the interview itself.

i. *Take the time to get to know them* - Unless someone hops on a call
saying, "hey our time is cut short", we highly recommend thanking them for
their time and asking mundane questions like, "how's your day" or "what have
you done today?" At minimum it's polite and best case scenario it opens the
space for unexpected dialogue.

ii. *Have a prepared list of questions* - The individual you're speaking with
has carved out time from their schedule to connect with you, likely with
nothing expected in return; the least you can do is prepare a list of 3 or 4
preferably-open ended questions. The added benefit is being able to compare
responses between companies with a controlled set of data-- useful in offer
negotiations.

iii. *Mind the time* - Fairly straight-forward point. For example, if you ask
for 15 minutes then keep an eye out for when the 12 or 13 minute mark comes and
acknowledge wanting to be respectful of their time. Perhaps pose one more
question and if they’re able to extend, they’ll say so; either way you're
ensuring being seen as a punctual and respectful person.

iv. *Thank them* - Lead with thanks for taking your call, end with thanks for
sharing their thoughts.

v. *Have an ask, especially if it's a network-related one* - Assuming the call
is going well, we encourage you to take a moment and make a key ask. At this
stage, a referral may be difficult but a networking ask might make more sense.
A good example is seeing whether or not they recommend you speak with anyone
else in the company or on their team.

You now have what it takes to reach out for informational interviews.It can be
hard to reach out of your comfort zone, but you can do it.  The only thing now
is to put this into practice!



## Reverse Recruiting

Here we'll discuss one of the most crucial, but often overlooked, strategies
involved in the job hunt: reverse recruiting. Our task here is to cover the
basics on: (1) **getting familiar with recruiters** (2) **what is reverse
recruiting** (3) **reviewing the interview process** (4) **reverse recruiting
strategies.** Our aim here is to solidify a new way of thinking, communicating,
and reaching out about your job hunt.

### Getting familiar with recruiters

Recruiting professionals and their responsibilities are a part of every single
organization in one way or another. For early staged and SMB companies,
recruiting might be an org-wide responsibility or fall upon the shoulders of
department heads and C-suite; for larger organizations, recruiters can become
highly specialized, spanning everything from finding professionals (sourcers),
coordinating interviews (recruiting coordinators) and being the consistent
point of contact throughout the process (recruiters). Whatever your experience,
recruiters are here to stay and a crucial part of your job hunt.

As you create your professional presence online and apply through job portals,
recruiters will review each aspect of what you share. In most cases, hundreds
if not thousands of applications pour in for a given role and applications may
fall through the cracks. Alternatively, a recruiter may reach out to you
through a trusted connection or online networking site based on what they see
about you. This latter approach is where we'll be focusing our attention in
this section in order to better understand the mind of a recruiter so we can
put to practice some of those strategies in a reverse recruiting scenario.

### What is reverse recruiting?

Reverse recruiting is a term that we define as playing the role of a
recruiter for your job search. It involves growing a skill recruiting
teams call “sourcing”, which is traditionally the process of identifying
key characteristics for a role and reviewing \resumes or online profiles
to aggregate leads; in the case of reverse recruiting, you, as the job
seeker, are identifying key characteristics in a job opportunity or in a
company’s culture and using that list of qualified roles or company
names to identify recruiters, hiring managers, engineers, and personal
connections worth contacting.

Recruiters similarly filter a sourcing campaign by location, companies,
industry, keywords or education (to name a few). As a job seeker, a
shared location, industry, company or educational background can make a
tremendous difference when reaching out to a new professional
acquaintance by providing credibility or social proof. As you might
imagine, sourcing typically happens at the beginning of a search
process, though it's often repeated and refined as a search goes on. In
your case, it's worth taking a moment to get a snapshot of the typical
technical interview process in order to know how to most effectively
source out recruiting leads.

## Reviewing the interview process

Reverse recruiting is dependent on a robust understanding of a typical
technical interview process:

      Stage 1             Stage 2              Stage 3
      ------------------- -------------------- --------------
      Job Search Begins   Application Review   Phone Screen

      Stage 4          Stage 5            Stage 6          Stage 7
      ---------------- ------------------ ---------------- ----------------
      Tech Interview   Onsite Interview   Offer Extended   Offer Accepted

To begin with, it's important to take the time to define where you want to end
up. In your job search, you'll define the type of role, company, size, industry
and workplace values that seem worth pursuing.  Once defined, you can more
accurately tie those aspects to specific companies and then begin to search for
recruiters and other company points of contact.

This process may require two or three different points of contact depending on
factors like available contact information or mutual connections. It's best to
get creative and look into tools to help equip you with crucial information
(more on that in a second!). An important tip to keep in mind directly
pertaining to the interview process: try and balance out your outbounds with
your current supply of interviews.  In other words, despite key traction early
on in your job search process, keep on sending those outreach emails and
applications through to stage 4 and 5 (tech screens and onsites); it's much
better to have an interested recruiter or fall back company in the face of a
lost opportunity than having all eggs in a single basket and needing to start
your search from scratch.
