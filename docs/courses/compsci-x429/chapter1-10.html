Welcome to the Tech Career Guide! This guide is written for anyone looking to get a
job in the tech industry. We hope to cram in everything we've learned from the
years experience we've had guiding the career change of coding school grads,
and combine that with experience of recruiting for top Silicon Valley
companies, into the best and most cutting-edge advice we can give for landing
your new job. Career changes never come easy, and the bigger the change, the
harder it will be. However, persistence combined with the structure and tips we
provide in this guide, we're confident you can make that life-changing
transition and build the career of your dreams!

> Consider completing one chapter a week, in order to complete in 5 weeks!


### The Career Framework

In this first chapter, we'll cover the basics to get you up to speed. This
includes: (1) \resume (2) social media (3) journaling & quantifying your work
(4) job seeking & time management.

**Getting a job as a new developer in the Bay Area is one part *what you know*,
one part *who you know*, and one part a bit of *luck*. To get a job, you will
probably need *all three*.**


| -------------------- | --------------------- | -----------------------------|
| What you know        | Who you know          | Luck                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -----------------------------|
| Programming languages| Networking            | Volume of applications       |
| Full-stack projects  | Volunteer projects    | Time management              |
| Algorithms           | Cold emails & coffee  | Persistence                  |
| Tools & frameworks   | Reverse recruiting    | Vary strategies              |

1. **What you know** - You actually need to be proficient at coding to get a
coding job --- no surprise here! However, you also have to *communicate* your
proficiency, and pass coding interviews.

2. **Who you know** - Go to meet-ups, go to networking events, and work on
projects outside of the class with other people. Nearly all of the students who we
have seen make immediate huge career changes had a connection to get their foot
in the door.

3. **Luck** - Every time you apply to a job you are "rolling the dice".  Roll
the dice as often as possible with sheer volume of applications, perseverance,
and good time management.  ^[Statistically, you have a 2.7% chance of getting
boxcars (two sixes when rolling a pair of dice), which is close to the same ratio
as getting to the final round of interviews from an application of a recent
coding school graduate, at least according to an article on the subject.]


With that, continue reading to plunge into working on the most important
document in your job search: Your Resume. Good luck!
