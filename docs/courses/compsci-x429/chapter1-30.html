## Social Media

In this section, we’re going to cover the role of social media and how it can
support you as a technical professional. Similar to a \resumeNoSpace, social
media is a place to host and connect with career related content and leads. For
this section, we’d like you to consider creating a presence on LinkedIn
AngelList and Twitter to go with your \resume and Github accounts. We'll walk
you through some aspects of (1) set up; (2).  how to position yourself as a
developer; and (3) common uses of each platform. Good luck!

### Getting Setting up and Signed In

As we mentioned earlier, social media is similar to a \resume in that it’s a
place designed to host all relevant career-related content for you but has the
advantage of not being limited by a single 8'x11' page.  Moreover, virtually
anyone online can discover you through your social media whereas a \resume is
only as good as its reach. Consequently, here are a quick few tips related to
signing up for the first time or double checking you’re placing your best foot
forward:

1. Choose emails wisely! Do your best to set up a professional email that
ideally uses your first and last name; on a related note, make sure that’s an
email you check frequently rather than give into the temptation to use a
spam-address (as outreach and notifications will be going there!)

2. Keep your name consistent. If you’re a Krista but you go by Kris, do that.
Alternatively, if you’re a Richie with loved ones but Richard in professional
circles, maybe start with that.

3. Choose a professional photo and consider keeping *it* consistent across your
profiles. A well-lit headshot (shoulders and above) taken in “portrait mode”
will do if you don’t readily have one.

4. Most platforms today give users the chance to spice up their profile with a
background image.Create your own or grab one off the internet. Just make sure
it compliments your profile picture and aligns to how you want to represent
yourself.

5. You only have a few lines to say something catchy that will get people to
want to scroll through your page, and if you're lucky, interest them enough to
follow you. Be clear, be concise, and keep it simple. If you've worked at
impressive organizations, or won a noteworthy award tag or mention those.

6. Use the URL to drive traffic to your personal website or other
profiles you’d like folks to view


### Check out a few examples below:

![](career/medias1/media/image5.png){width="2.838542213473316in"

![](career/medias1/media/image6.png){width="3.1276629483814524in"
height="1.4114588801399826in"}\


Now you try! This is the first step toward growing your online
professional presence.


### Positioning Yourself as a Developer

It’s really important to make it clear that you’re no longer a Account Manager
or Ride Share Driver or *insert last vocational role* but now a developer. From
the get-go, make sure your profile heading, bio, and URL clearly communicate
so. In addition to what we discussed above, add “Software Engineer” or
“Software Developer” or a link to your Github or personal portfolio in the
appropriate title, heading or summary. It’s worth asking a friend, *“from your
perspective, is it clear I’m a Software Engineer specializing in
X-technologies?”* If so, great! If it’s not clear, continue to gain feedback on
how you could change that.

The next step in positioning yourself as a developer is 
content relevance. Two criteria really stand out, especially when you’re
considering LinkedIn or AngelList and sharing your prior experience. (1) Is the
content relevant to my narrative or new role as a developer? If the answer is
"yes", include it. Helpful questions to consider:

* Does this help position me as an industry expert for a particular field?
* Did I impact a particular demographic, size of group, product target
  audience, clientele. etc?
* Can I begin to craft a helpful narrative around the idea or is it better to
  leave it off?
* Will it show a significant gap in work timeline? And can I address this gap
  otherwise?

The second question is similar, (2) is this content going to be distracting on
this platform. If the answer to this question is "yes", then maybe consider
leaving it out. A good rule of thumb is deciding if it's a part of your "brand"
(or how others perceive you) or if this content will take a long time to
clarify and possibly cause the conversation to steer away from your new
vocation.

### Common Uses of Social Media

height="2.3775459317585304in"}\

Here we’re diving into a helpful overview of how these platforms can (and
are being) used!

#### LinkedIn for Recruiting and Networking

* *Recruiting*: the de facto recruiting tool, it’s set up so recruiters
can view you by title, location, experience, etc.
* *Networking*: the digital business card, be sure to promptly follow up
in person networking events with linkedin requests, as well as ping
recruiters and folks with whom you share connections for coffee etc.\

#### AngelList for Startups, detailed Job Seeking, and Compensation Comparison

* *Startups*: the biggest online startup hub with new companies, role posts and
  funding info
* *Job Seeking*: their best tool (IMHO) is for job seekers, being able to
  clearly view roles, compensation (salary and equity), location, company and
  more. It’s a great reference tool when considering jobs.

#### Twitter for Networking, Developer updates, and Hashtags (A.K.A.  community)

* *Networking*: Twitter is the best way to connect/ network, virtually, in real
  time around interests, events, technologies, companies or interesting people
* *Developer updates*: following
  [*@javascript*](https://twitter.com/javascript?lang=en) or
  [*@nodejs*](https://twitter.com/nodejs) are perfect ways to keep cutting edge
  as a dev
* *Hashtags*: participate in great hashtags like
  [*\#100daysofcode*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=tyah)
  to meaningfully connect with others

As you can see, the possibilities are extensive. Take some time to invest in a
social media account that proudly represents you and consider exploring new
ways of engaging with the tech community with it.


### Going deeper: LinkedIn

#### A few examples of filled-out LinkedIn profiles

These are taken out of a pool of real colleagues and former students. The
images are anonymized versions of full LinkedIn profiles, and thus too long to
be included here, but you should definitely take a look!

* Great example: [imgur.com/a/XbcaaJD](https://imgur.com/a/XbcaaJD) - An
  intermediate engineer -- note the level of completion, and the heavily
  personalized brand statement.

* Good example: [imgur.com/a/zi7zxYx](https://imgur.com/a/zi7zxYx) - A bit more
  fresh from coding school

#### LinkedIn goals

* Import your revised tech \resume into your LinkedIn profile. You have a
  little more room now to expand, so be sure to flesh out each position with
  tech buzzwords and teamwork / leadership related keywords

* Be extra sure to fill in your skills with your top keywords. Order them how
  you want to emphasize them, based on your own preference and ability.

* **Fill in your LinkedIn \resume to 100%**

#### LinkedIn coding course grad goals

Currently taking a coding course, such as Kickstart Coding? Here are some extra
requirements:

* Add all students and instructional staff from the course as connections

* Fill in your in-class projects

* Endorse other students in class for their skills^[And passively
  aggressively stare at them until they endorse you back for the skills you
  want to highlight.]

#### LinkedIn Tips

* If you are concerned about age-ism, feel free to leave out your college
  graduation date^[Many coding school students are over 30. Statistically, in
  the tech industry, the older you are past 30, the more prejudice you will
  face because of your age.]

* Add a tasteful and striking cover photo, and use a professional and clear
  head-shot for your profile picture

* Be sure to add volunteer work

* Don't skimp on your personal brand statement

* Always create a custom URL -- don't just go with the random digits


## Time Management

In this section, we're going to cover the basics of time management and how to
ensure top success when job hunting. Time management is a skill and can be
cultivated, just as your technical skills were cultivated with time and
repetition. It all comes down to two major keys: clarity and intention. We'll
break down these keys as you read while walking you through (1) why
cultivating time management even matters (2)  clarifying, prioritizing, and
following through with activities (3)  helpful tools for effective time
management. Good luck!

### Why care about time management 

It’s really hard to pursue something if you don’t have a good understanding why
(and how) it can be valuable. Time management is one of those things that is
often really misunderstood and causes high return when properly invested. When
done well, it leads to using more of your time to do what you’d prefer. When
done poorly, it often brings nagging guilt, distraction, and a mad scramble to
hit a deadline.

[*Lucy
MacDonald*](https://www.watkinspublishing.com/shop/you-can-manage-time-better-lucy-macdonald/),
author of *Learn to manage your time*, helps us understand some of the
underlying factors of poor time management: perfectionism, fear of failure, and
even fear of success. These potentially paralyzing psychological barriers often
cause us to miss the small wins in consistent, methodical steps that lead us
down the path of effective time management. Perfectionism can trip us up in the
ideation phase by convincing us that we have to get everything right in order
to get started; fear of failure, very similarly, can impede us trying something
new despite the fact that everything we currently do was new to us at some
point; finally, fear of success can be another underlying factor limiting our
ability to act against poor time management or procrastination.

When we identify which of the three factors is most ailing our workflow, we can
begin to address aspects of effort with small steps beginning with clarifying
activities we need to accomplish; prioritizing how to get them done; and
following through with our activities to completion.

### Clarify, Prioritize, Follow Through

Coming back to our first point and finding it really hard to pursue something
if you don’t have a good understanding, clarifying exactly what you want or
need to accomplish is a crucial first step toward making the most of your time.
Sometimes you're flooded with an unending number of requests and other times
you have a vague sense of what exactly needs to be done; in both circumstances,
beginning with writing down your tasks at hand is key. The alternative is more
easily being swept into your circumstances’ definition of what needs to be
done.

As a developer this is called firefighting or putting out a fire.

![](career/medias1/media/image4.png){width="2.7552088801399823in"
height="1.3095745844269466in"}\

So how does one avoid falling into the trap of poor time management skills?
Well, after taking stock and clarifying exactly what needs to be done,
prioritize your list. This process of filtering can be done by establishing
your urgent needs vs your important needs. Doubtless, things will fall into
both categories and therefore likely rise to the top of your to-complete list,
success relies on *not* perpetually focusing on the urgent. This is the
equivalent of only playing defense--- reacting and responding--- instead of
pushing forward and accomplishing your intended goals. In this situation,
activity can quickly become a substitute for progress or peace of mind.

Take a look at the following table to better understand how you can better
clarify which falls into which.

#### Urgent VS. Important - decision-making matrix

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **(\#1). Urgent and Important**       **(\#2). Important but Not Urgent**
  ------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------
  *&gt; Crisis\                         *&gt; Relationships\
  &gt; Deadlines\                       &gt; Planning\
  &gt; Problems*                        &gt; Preparation*

  **(\#3). Urgent but Not Important**   **(\#4). Not Urgent and Not Important**

  *&gt; Interruptions\                  *&gt; Time wasters\
  &gt; Meetings\                        &gt; Most emails\
  &gt; Activities*                      &gt; Busy work*
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to any graph you might have seen, the idea is to be regularly
operating in quadrant \#2: Important but not urgent. Though getting and
staying here is a byproduct of clarifying, prioritizing, and following
through---*how* you go about each is highly personal. Let’s discuss some
avenues.

### Helpful tools for effective time management

Here's where the rubber meets the road in practical suggestions. First
up, tools and approaches to help you clarify activities and time
management:

-   [Harvest (getharvest.com)](https://www.getharvest.com/) - this app is a great
    time tracker designed to help demonstrate where you're allocating
    your time. You can set and label tasks then click a timer for
    later review.

-   [Evernote (evernote.com)](https://evernote.com/) - this is a pretty great
    note-taking app that’s as simple as signing up, adding content,
    finding content (as you need it) and marking things finished.

-   [Wunderlist (wunderlist.com)](https://www.wunderlist.com/) - another great tool
    to help clarify aspects of your daily life and activities. This
    platform has a collaboration-feature to help you keep organized
    with the people in your life.

Next up, prioritizing that list of newly clarified activities:

-   [Trello (trello.com)](https://trello.com/en) - this app is a great for
    making sure you stay on top of the right things at the right
    times. Very user friendly, at a glance you can set and see
    pertinent information on any task.

-   [Google Calendar (calendar.google.com)](https://calendar.google.com/) -
    Often overlooked is the easy to use, likely-attached-to-your-email Google
    cal. With reminders, tasks, and invites it's a major key for major success.

-   [Todoist (todoist.com)](https://todoist.com/) - is that sticky note or list
    of things to do except digitized. It holds a ton of features to
    help you not only define your work but even set alarms and levels
    of priority.

Finally, we're onto following through with every task and the satisfactory of a
job well done:

-   [Huntr (huntr.io)](https://huntr.io) - a must have for any job seeker
    with an easy-to-use chrome extension, Huntr is similar to Trello
    in its flow allowing a top-tier job search snapshot success.

-   [Asana (asana.com)](https://asana.com/) - many tech
    companies use Asana, so this one is definitely worth trying.

-   [ClickUp](http://clickup.com) - a project management tool, it's likely
    holding a ton more features than you need but is worth taking a look
    depending on your needs (i.e. coding projects, tasks etc.)

Try out a few of these tools and see what sticks!

## Developer Journal

In this section, we're going to cover the role of a developer journal and how
it can support you throughout your time as both a technical student and
professional. As you're getting started, this is the type of document that you
can refer to on a daily or a weekly basis to hold your thoughts, questions,
breakthroughs and solutions as you learn and build.  Some developers, like we
see here on Reddit, have been [*using a developer journal for more than 15
years!*](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/28zvh9/the_power_of_keeping_a_coding_journal/cigulu3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
As you read, we'll walk you through some aspects of (1) why it’s useful and
(2) different ways to consider structuring your journal.

### Why journal 

One of the most practical reasons for beginning a journal is having a single
source for all things you have to think about. Once you get working on a
project, a number of concerns come to mind:\ An innumerable number of thoughts
go through you head as you develop: pending issues you’ll get back to later;
design decisions; potential algorithm alternatives; deprecated libraries;
possible bugs or errors… the list goes on.

A journal dedicates space with as much / little structure as would be helpful
for its user. Sure, when you're writing code comments are helpful reminders
(and good practice) and whiteboard space is a bigger blank canvas but your
journal transcends the constraints of time, code-review or location.

### Structuring your journal

* Start your journal by writing your ideal job description. Don't hold anything
  back.^[In the next section, you will be gaining greater industry awareness,
  which is a great opportunity to get access.]

* Then, answer three questions in your journal, based on the 3 principles
  mentioned in the introduction:

    1. **What you know:** What are your technical strong-suits? Weaknesses?
        * Make a list of your strongest technical points --- how can you "sell
          yourself" based on these points?
        * Make a list of your weakest technical points --- pick one or two to
          commit to strengthening in an on-going review

    2. **Who you know:** Do you presently work in the tech industry, but in a
    non-technical role? Have you heard of tech companies that maybe intersect
    with your current industry? Do you have any other "ins?" Make sure to
    mention to all your friends and colleagues that you are searching, and if
    any of their companies have an opening to let you know.^[Although
    networking is important, we want to make clear that this isn't a
    recommendation for you go recklessly pester all your friends in the tech
    world for a interview, unless you know they're open to helping you. You'll
    have to play that by ear. That said, it's not weird at all to
    casually mention to all your friends or acquaintances that you are job
    hunting --- not to mention, there is sometimes even an internal referral
    bonus.]

    3. **Luck:** How much time could you set aside in a week to do job
    applications?^[Job hunting is a time-consuming process, and can be
    draining, too, especially as you will only be hearing "no" (or nothing at
    all) before you get to a coveted "yes." Set aside time for it,
    keeping the emotional drain in mind.]

### Learning topics

Beyond that, what's fair game for a code career journal? Honestly, it's up to
you but the following are a handful of suggestions:

1.  Develop a learning plan (i.e. approach or links to learning new
    technologies, new skill)

2.  Celebrate successes and new learning

3.  List problems, describe attempted solutions, and explain lessons
    learned

4.  Describe experiments tried to promote logical thinking and the
    scientific method

5.  Record creative ideas and inspirational thoughts to remember and
    tackle at another time

6.  Take notes of questions still unanswered

7.  Complete a self-assessment

8.  Respond to specific prompts, such as:

    -   Write about something you still want to learn.

    -   Outline a coding task that you found difficult.

    -   Describe what you accomplished today.

    -   How would you rate your final project?

    -   What are your strengths in learning to code?

9. Issue tracker / source code
    - Another practical approach: using your journal as an Issue Tracker

    -   The outstanding issue you forgot to implement

    -   The library you forgot to upgrade

    -   The bug you never fixed

    -   The code comment for that code that could be replaced by a better
        algorithm

    -   The TODO comment for that missing error handling

    -   The clever design decision you need to document

### How to journal

All in all, the power's in your capable hands to create something suited to
your continued learning and success. Consider the following options:

* A notes app such as EverNote or Google doc will do, if that's what you are
  most familiar with
* Also consider using Markdown in your favorite text editor, or a dedicated
  Markdown editing editor (Google for a big selection)
* Some students and job hunters really enjoyed using Medley Text
  ([`medleytext.net`](https://medleytext.net/)), a free cross-platform
  note-taking app specifically for programming
* A very minimalist terminal-based journaling tool to check out is JRNL
  ([`jnrl.sh`](https://jrnl.sh/))
