        <h3>Modulo</h3>
        <p>Modulo.js is a dependency-free, self-packing Web Component framework
        in a single 2000 line file. It's novel modular design and HTML-first
        “low-code” approach lets even JavaScript-shy designers
        build components.  I've been working on Modulo off-and-on for years,
        but it's just now getting to the point to show off.

        <h3>OmniConverter</h3>
        <h4>Note: While functioning for a variety of applications, the
        documentation is incomplete, and is in development hiatus.</h4>
        <p>OmniConverter is a stateless HTTP-based microservice (and
        mini-framework) for building conversion graphs for stateless (except
        for cache), won-the-fly media file format conversion.  Define
        converters to form a conversion graph, that can be tested with the
        included commandline tool. This causes types to get converted into each
        other in a series of steps.</p>

        <h3>Scroll Editor</h3>
        <h4>Note: Mostly undocumented, and is in development hiatus.</h4>
        <p>Scroll Editor was a Markdown based document processing toolkit &amp;
        GUI editor. The goal was creating a structure around editing a
        collection of markdown files in a <code>.git</code>-based
        revision-controlled system. They then could be compiled and outputted
        to different exported formats, the initial target being HTML, but
        fine-grained PDF and other exports were intended as well.</p>
        <p>Scroll Editor was supposed to take "power user" tools of revision
        control, and precise markdown-based editing, and wrap them up in a
        "Scrivener"-style product aimed at serious writers.</p>

        <h3>2019 | Whiteboard</h3>
        <h4>Note: Functional and useful, but in development hiatus and looking
        for project adopters to keep the packages up to date.</h4>
        <p>Whiteboard is slideshow application for <strong>teaching
        programming</strong>.  It embeds a code editor, terminal, and web
        browser into a slide-show like interface to <strong>eliminate
        context-switches</strong> and dead-space, while enabling more content
        content to be set-up ahead of time.  It's great for guiding code-heavy
        classroom lectures, tutorials, workshops, and
        <strong>webinars</strong>.</p>

        <h3>2013 | FS Gamer - Graphics Optimizer</h3>
        <h4>Note: Abandoned.</h4>

        <p>For a full description, read <a href="https://www.techdrivein.com/2013/03/fsgamer-fullscreen-linux-gaming-simplfied-opensource-tool.html">Tech
        Drive-In's 2013 explainer, when I first released FS Gamer</a>.</p>

        <p>FS Gamer was a desktop utility I developed in Python and GTK that
        allowed executing games (or any other intensive app) in a separate "X11
        Server", or basically another log-in session, which ran a light-weight
        desktop and was optimized for lighter resource usage and higher
        performance while playing games. At the time, this provided massive
        speed-ups compared to running normally on GNOME or KDE.</p>

        <p>Although my utility FSGamer is abandoned, in modern times Valve
        Software has developed a much tightly optimized system that does
        something similar by running games in separate highly-optimized Wayland
        session. The most recent (as of 2023) of this project is <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/">Valve's gamescope
        here</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2mnbyRgXkY&amp;t=25695s">and a
        presentation on it here</a>).

        <h3>2007 | Warzone 2100 Resurrection Project (Music)</h3>

        <p>I composed a soundtrack that was used in Warzone 2100
        Resurrection Project. You can <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/album/38736/warzone-2100-soundtrack">listen
        to my soundtrack for this game here</a>. My music package for the game
        used to be on all the distributions and repositories, but
        recent versions use a different soundtrack. However, I haven't tried
        it, but <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/warzone-2100-contingency-with-tonal-discrepancy">it
        would seem a community member actually created a mod in 2018 that puts
        my soundtrack back in</a>!</p>

        <p>If you like fast-paced, 3D real-time strategy games with fun, customizable unit types,
        then check out the open-source, community-maintained game, then
        <a href="https://wz2100.net/">download and play Warzone 2100 here</a>.</p>

        <h3>2005 | Nexuiz (FX)</h3>
        <p>I developed some sound effects for the original
        Nexuiz, a classic arena-style shooter. Due to ownership disputes, the
        original Nexuiz is defunct.  Nexuiz's page <a href="http://www.alientrap.com/games/nexuiz/">on Alien Trap</a>,
        where I'm credited as "michaelb", is little more than a memorial.</p>
        <p>However, there is a super fun successor project called Xonotic that
        I highly recommend. If you want a free, open-source,
        community-maintained fast-paced arena-style shooter with loads of maps,
        weapons, and game modes, then <a href="https://xonotic.org/">download
        and play Xonotic here</a>.</p>

<p>From time to time I work on gaming projects. While none of my games are
available on any App Stores any more, a couple of my puzzle games are available
below, on Itch.io. I start far more projects than I finish, however: The
background GIF comes from an abandoned 3D voxel farming game.</p>

        <p><strong>Live Syllabus Learning Management System</strong> is a
        modern online class communication and management suite.  My team and I
        built Live Syllabus for administrating online classes with a "flipped
        classroom" approach, to better adapt to the reality of a pandemic
        world. Live Syllabus is probably not interesting to most website
        visitors.  However, if you are part of an educational institution that
        struggles with online teaching, and you think you may benefit from a
        modern LMS designed by teachers for teachers, for the current era, then
        definitely get in contact!</p>
