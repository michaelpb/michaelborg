        <h3>The Plan</h3><br />
        <ol>
            <li>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Free 10 - 30min initial call</strong> to help
            cultivate your product idea, and figure out an estimate and
            quote</li>
            <li>ðŸ’» <strong>MVP</strong> (&ldquo;Minimum Viable Product&rdquo;)-
            I function as a CTO-boost to your team: I personally architect
            and/or greenfield the product, while helping you hire and train up
            a full agile SCRUM team to take over</li>
            <li>ðŸš€ <strong>LAUNCH DAY!</strong> - Your product launches...
            hopefully to the stratosphere! You and your team will continue with
            the roadmap for version 2.0, and I will ride off into the sunset
            (don't worry, though, not <em>too</em> far away into the sunset, in
            case we need a sequel!)</li>

            <li>Do you want a <strong>turn-key experience</strong>, where
            <strong>you just bring the concept and I do the rest</strong>? I
            can take "just an idea on a piece of paper" to "software product
            with trained-up dev team"</li>
            <li>Do you want a <strong>supercharged, experienced
            contractor</strong> where I massively accelerate your development
            team's productivity with my years of engineering, software
            education, and team-building experience? Let's chat!</li>
            <li>Are you an entrepreneur who simply wants a dependable start-up
            veteran for <strong>expert consulting</strong> on software
            development or the industry?  In as little as an hour, I have
            helped dozens of entrepreneurs <strong>save massive amounts of time
            and money</strong> by asking the right "SWOT" questions and picking
            the right "beach-head".</li>
