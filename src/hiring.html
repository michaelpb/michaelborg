<h2>Hiring for a team</h2>
<section>
    <aside>
        <p><strong>Recruiter?</strong> My business attracts top tech talent
        from the San Francsico Bay Area and beyond, trained and eager for
        intermediate-level (or junior) positions in Python, React JavaScript,
        and more. Drop me a line and I'll hook you up!

<h2>Project quotes & contracting</h2>

<section>
    <aside>
        <p>My site has a lot of the stuff I build. I also build stuff for other
        people, and love advising (and contracting!) to bring <em>your</em>
        project to life.</p>
        <br />
        <p>If you think my skillset might be the ticket to help you launch your
        or your team's project into the stratosphere (or at least give it a
        little boost), I'd love to chat!</p>

        <!--
        <p><strong>What things do I do?</strong> Things I've been paid to do:
        engineering management, backend and devops engineering, frontend
        engineering and design work, curriculum development and instruction,
        public speaking and workshops, and even business development and
        fundraising. I've worked in big web companies (e.g. Facebook,
        Microsoft), small research-oriented organizations (e.g. CHTC @ UW, Cray
        Inc.), and have also bootstrapped my own start-up, which is now going
        on 4 years of profitability. I've worn quite a variety of hats at this
        point, so maybe there's a way I could help solve a problem or two you
        (or your team) are facing!</p>
