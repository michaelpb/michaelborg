# Networking

Chances are, your next position is going to come from someone you know right
now, or someone you will meet in the next few months.^[It's very common to hear
statistics like: 80% of jobs never end up getting posted anywhere. Referrals
from existing employees make up 40% percent of new hires, but only 7% of
applicants (giving you an almost 6x statistical advantage). I've found it hard
to validate these exact statistics from a more trusted source than blog posts;
however, from anecdotal experience, it holds up completely, as nearly every one
of our students who made big career changes quickly did so through
connections.]

In this section, we're going to cover the basics of networking, both on and
offline. By reading the following you’ll have a better sense of how to begin
strategizing approaches to building new connections at MeetUps, hackathons or
on LinkedIn. As you read, we'll clarify content related to: (1) taking stock of
where you are (2) getting started with networking (3) then cover networking
in-person (4) and online.

## Where are you now?

Let's start with taking stock of where you are currently in your career.

* If you do not have a coding job right now, networking and building your
  narrative networking becomes ten times more important. A big change in your
  career is always hard, and the bigger the change the more persistence it will
  take.  Prepare yourself now: You *will* have to step way outside your comfort
  zone!

* Do you not have a coding job, but you already at a tech company or a company
  that has a software development department? ***Always pursue internal
  transitions first.*** You might not get much of a pay-raise^[They know your
  current salary, which means they can drive a much harder bargain than you
  can.], but your foot is already in the door.^[Even if you don't like your
  current company, your first goal is getting your title changed, while your
  next goal might be finding a company you like. In 6 months to a year after
  your title change, start applying on the down-low and see if you get more
  hits.] Chat with your manager or coworkers, and see if you can start doing
  coding tasks on the side. Most companies need more coding "muscle,"
  so if you prove your worth they'd welcome you gradually switching your duties
  at the company, and eventually your job title.

* Do you have friends or acquaintances at tech companies?  Send out feelers
  right now: Make sure *all* your friends knows you are job hunting.^[If you
  are nervous socially about this, don't be! Hiring typically takes place
  through connections, and you aren't asking them to vouch for you, just to
  keep an eye out and maybe hand over your \resumeNoSpace. It can be introduced
  as simply as mentioning in person you've been job hunting, "oh I've been
  meaning to ask you, do there happen to be any open positions where you
  are working? None? Well let me know if something pops up. It's tough out
  there!" Or: "hey, I've been applying to so many full stack jobs these days.
  Is your company hiring at all? Really? Cool, do you know who I could reach
  out to? I don't know if you have the time but if you get the chance could you put
  us in touch?"] Also, reach out to friends, colleagues, and acquaintances.^[If
  you're not sure how to phrase this, consider the following format: "Hey,
  how's it going?  Been a while!  We'll have to *[grab coffee / do lunch / grab
  drinks / etc]* again some time. So as you may know I've been doing this
  *[bootcamp / career development course / etc]*. I really want *[to get
  out of my current job / get into software development / etc]* so I'm just
  asking around to see if there are any open positions at *[company name]* -- I
  didn't see much on the site, and it seems like a pretty awesome place to
  work!"] Just the simple act of their handing in a \resume or forwarding your
  email to a decision-maker could put you on a *much* shorter list!


## Getting started with Networking

Networking is easier than you might think. It's not all business cards
and superfluous conversation but can also be an opportunity to reconnect
with old peers, friends, work acquaintances and mutual-admirers of a
certain technology. If you've never been in a formal networking setting,
don't worry. A couple easy places to find some include:
[*Eventbrite*](https://www.eventbrite.com/),
[*Meetup*](https://www.meetup.com/),
[*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) and
[*Facebook*](https://www.facebook.com/). Searching for a tech or affinity group
as well as relevant hashtags can lead to a number of new events that are well
suited to meeting others.  Something to note: a significant number of events
are free but for the ones that cost, mentioning that you're a student (if that
applies) or from an underrepresented group can often help offset costs. Another
great strategy to lowering costs is volunteering! Usually volunteering involves
needing to set up or greet people; both are a great way to naturally meet
people as part of the work and also mitigate some awkwardness all while getting
access to a cool event.

## Networking In-Person

Despite having the skills you're about to learn, networking can seem
intimidating. Especially when you're actually standing at an event, in
front of an actual person and thinking intensely about what might be
said without sounding *too* awkward. It's understandable, we've all been
there. In the spirit of making things a bit less painful and, dare I
say, enjoyable the following are few tips to think about when attempting
to make a connection:

a. **Know your setting & audience** - Take time to do your research to see
    where you're headed and establish who’s attending or which company is
    hosting.  Most events have a guest list available with the ability to do
    some light social media looking to better identify people of interest or
    folks with mutual connections. Those extra few minutes are worth checking
    when you're making small talk.

b. **Shoot for groups but don't avoid individuals** - It's worth saying
    individuals can be hit or miss in a networking setting mainly because
    there’s only one of them. Groups allow for more than one entry point where
    you might resonate with the second person present if the first one falls
    flat. Wondering how to open? First, greet everyone and introduce yourself.
    After intro’s, a reliable first question is as simple as, "So what
    specifically brings you here tonight?" This question comes across as
    natural, open-ended question, not too deep and fair game to answer as
    briefly or extensively as one might want.

    A real value add, and ability to establish yourself as a solid
    networker, is the ability to begin facilitating connections based off
    the responses of other people. For instance, mentioning how Janice, whom
    you met earlier near the hor d’orves, might want to talk with that other
    person because of *X-thing* in common you just learned.


c. **Notice nearby individuals; invite them in** - Now hopefully
    you're in a group and found your tribe for the evening. Despite the comfort
    of the group, continue to be somewhat aware of your settings.  Maybe you
    notice someone else seeking to get involved in the conversation you’re at;
    if so, invite them in. A natural way to invite the nearby individual in is
    by turning toward them and asking: "what do you think about *[insert
    question being discussed]*?" In addition to being seen as a thoughtful and
    inclusive conversationalist, this also potentially serves as a helpful out
    when you're looking to move on from the conversation. How so? Simple, you
    can potentially integrate this new person, get the new chat going and then
    gracefully bow out to try again in another setting.



## Networking Online

Online networking might seem easier, since you have a screen and time to think
between every message but it comes with its own unique challenges to navigate.
Essentially, you're relegated to one dimension of self (*i.e. no in-person
presence*) to convey emotion or other added benefits of being face to face with
someone else. Another unique factor includes character or typing limits.
Despite these limitations, networking online is far reaching and there are five
keys that might help your efforts bear fruit.

a. **Find a useful angle** - Similar to guest lists, LinkedIn serves as
    a personal data mining tool for professionals, lending useful insights on
    how to request someone's time or connection. (i.e. mutual previous company,
    approaching your connection as a "newer developer," or requesting coffee.)

b. **Think, "Ask"** - After leveraging your angle, develop the "ask."
    It needs to be posed in light of a few specific things:

    i. *Your specific invitation vs. non specific invite*. Don’t come to a
    conversation unprepared. it reflects poorly on you as a professional and
    makes it seem like you don’t value someone's time.

    ii. *Considering your most ideal desired results*. What is the best case
    scenario? Establish that reality, acknowledge it and then move to the next
    criteria to establish whether or not you can run with it as an actual *ask*.

    iii. *Finally, establishing whether your ideal ask is reasonable* (as these
    two attributes are not necessarily mutually exclusive). This will vary case
    by case but depends on factors such as time allotment, medium of connection
    and weighing one outcome versus another.

c. **Mitigate the awkwardness** - Mitigating awkwardness is all about
    taking the time to look at what you have in common with someone without
    forcing the likelihood of your connection on them. This act serves as the
    process of building up to your "ask" by preemptively acknowledging the
    distance between x & y (x being you and y being them). A natural place to
    attempt this is after sending your connection via LinkedIn or right after a
    email introduction (or warm handoff from a professional acquaintance). You
    can engage with any of the following example next steps:

    - "Hey I noticed we share a mutual passion for\dots{}"
    - "You seem to have a lot to say about *\[insert topic\]*, would you be
      open to sharing thoughts on\dots{}"
    - "Thanks for making a connection, I’m wondering if you’d be open to
      referring\dots{}" *Oh and lastly,*
    - Use the power of your “ask” as an introduction.

d. **Reframing** - Another helpful tip is taking the time to reframe
    the recipient of your connection/email:

    i. *Integrate something unique* into an your outreach email.

    ii. *Lead with a compliment* (skills, language, achievement) without
    sounding cheesy or corny. Perhaps mention a recent article on their company
    or the team's new product growth. Especially do this if you’re aspiring to
    achieve similar goals and want to know how they did it.

    iii. *Put yourself in their shoes*. If you were a Sr. SWE and a Junior SWE
    reached out for a connection to ask for 15 minutes of their time or a half
    hour over coffee near your office, what would you say? More than likely,
    yes, assuming you had the bandwidth. That’s likely how your recipient feels
    as well.

e. **Positioning yourself** - Really key: Figuring out how to position
    yourself as someone your recipient is sure they can assist. People don't
    want to do *everything* for others but they're inclined to help someone
    along the way. That said, make it clear what your value add is. You can
    share about the work you've done in company projects or take another angel
    to highlight a similar language, identity, group/activity affinity (i.e.
    React, fellow UC Davis grad or avid fellow cyclist).


Every situation and contact will be different, but these should function as
some initial strategies to keep in mind when building new relationships.

# Cover Letters

Now we'll discuss the cover letter portion of an application. Our
task here is to cover the basics on: (1) **what is a cover letter** and (2)
**how do you structure one?** Our aim here is to optimize your time and effort
while encouraging a clear and meaningful voice.

## What's a cover letter?

Usually accompanied by a \resumeNoSpace, the cover letter is an introductory
document designed to help convey a more personal snapshot of who you are as an
applicant. Specifically, it takes career and related \resume highlights and
points them out in a manner related to the company or role description. Cover
letters generally abide by the one page rule.^[1 single-sided page, 2ish
paragraphs, never more than 3] It's vital to keep it concise, as hiring
managers receive hundreds if not thousands of cover letters for a given role.^[
If you're looking for examples, here are a few resources:\
[`stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/11/developer-cover-letter`](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/11/developer-cover-letter/)\
[`zety.com/blog/engineering-cover-letter-example`](https://zety.com/blog/engineering-cover-letter-example)\
[`monster.com/career-advice/article/web-developer-cover-letter`](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/web-developer-cover-letter)\
[`thebalancecareers.com/cover-letter-opening-sentences-examples-2061030`](https://thebalancecareers.com/cover-letter-opening-sentences-examples-2061030)
]

## Are they still relevant?

Cover letters are still requested surprisingly often.  Some companies will
prefer them, some require them, and others never take the time to request.
Regardless, you don't want to find yourself completely avoiding a company
simply because they require a cover letter. Alternatively, it would be a shame
to allocate hours to a single document just to get rejected or never hear back.

So how do you ensure you're ready while saving time? We suggest using a
template to save time and effort.  The template can be a go-to doc, with
information already typed out and anywhere from prompts to a couple key work
examples pre-typed.  We don't advise using the exact same cover letter for
every application, but having a selection of pieces to assemble saves time, and
that time adds up quickly when you're applying for dozens or eventually
hundreds of positions.


## Structuring a cover letter

Now that we know what a cover letter entails, let's see how to structure it for
success.

The following is a reliable structure: *Greeting, hook / introduction, body,
and a close.*


a. **Greeting** - Ideally, you can use tools like LinkedIn and
    AngelList, or your network, to discover who will specifically view your
    letter. This works well for SMBs, startups, and teams who share the
    recruiting point of contact but not every company you apply to fits this
    description. What then? Try one of these two options:

    1. **Get as close as you can by addressing the dept** with "Dear Data
    Engineering hiring manager" *or*
    2. **Play it safe** with "*(optional: Dear) Hiring Manager*"

b. **Hook (introduction)** - Many of us learned the K-12 writing
    strategy of beginning with a "hook" or something to grab the reader's
    attention. Cover letters are a great place to dust off that strategy and
    use it as a way to keep them reading. The goal is to grab attention, which
    means it's okay to be creative with the way you do it. 
    It's possible a "*I'm interested in applying for your posted front end
    role.*" might get the benefit of the doubt but stack it against a jazzed-up
    introduction and it might influence the impression of the role’s hiring
    manager when viewing your \resume or listed achievements. Check out these
    examples:

    - **Mention a contact or mutual connection** - "Jessica D. Buggs is a
      mutual connection of ours from Blend and thought my problem solving
      skills would be a great fit for this team."

    - **Share an accomplishment** - "Formerly, at Yelp, I exceeded my sales
      quota 3 quarters straight by 33%..."

    - **Connect the position to your narrative** - "I'm super excited about
      what your company is doing to disrupt bio-lab work, as it reflects my
      own journey from..."

    - **Refer to a recent publication, milestone or product user experience** -
      "After reading yesterday's TechCrunch article covering the 4 Keys to
      eCommerce, I had to reach out immediately and beat the upcoming influx of
      \resumes that are sure to follow."

c. **Body** - Now to the bulkiest part of your cover letter, the body.  Here
you'll address two key ideas:

    - **Make it clear why you'd want to work with this team and company** -
      This structure should come easier if you'd completed Milestone 2 on story
      and narrative. The aim here is expressing the most significant reasons
      this team, brand, service or product has personally influenced you.
      After stating your reason, substantiate it. Bonus points if you can tie
      it directly to the role you're pursuing *and* your own work
      accomplishments that you'll be discussing in the next paragraph.

    - **Make it clear why they should want to work with you** - This is your
      space to brag and help your Hiring Manager reader recognize your
      relevant, noteworthy accomplishments. What you write about is entirely up
      to how you and the given job description. If your strength is industry
      expertise, go for it; perhaps it's prior management experience-- great!
      Another approach can be highlighting your exceptional behavioral skills,
      especially in a team or client-oriented world. Whichever you choose, make
      it clear how you've succeeded in a similar manner to what’s being looked
      for in the role you're pursuing.

c. **Closing** - Finally time to bring the cover letter to a close.  There
    are two key components to a good cover letter closing:

    1. **Close with an actionable statement** - your closing sentence is a
    perfect opportunity to accomplish three things (1) communicate appreciation
    for the reader’s time while (2) reiterating enthusiasm and (3) fit for the
    role. Consider the following example: "thank you for your time, I'm excited
    to learn more about next steps and how my time biology background can
    further the mission of BioFuture."

    2. **Use a formal valediction** such as "Sincerely" or "Best" or "Best
    regards" followed by your full professional name.


# Reverse Recruiting

Here we'll discuss one of the most crucial, but often overlooked, strategies
involved in the job hunt: reverse recruiting. Our task here is to cover the
basics on: (1) **getting familiar with recruiters** (2) **what is reverse
recruiting** (3) **reviewing the interview process** (4) **reverse recruiting
strategies.** Our aim here is to solidify a new way of thinking, communicating,
and reaching out about your job hunt.

## Getting familiar with recruiters

Recruiting professionals and their responsibilities are a part of every single
organization in one way or another. For early staged and SMB companies,
recruiting might be an org-wide responsibility or fall upon the shoulders of
department heads and C-suite; for larger organizations, recruiters can become
highly specialized, spanning everything from finding professionals (sourcers),
coordinating interviews (recruiting coordinators) and being the consistent
point of contact throughout the process (recruiters). Whatever your experience,
recruiters are here to stay and a crucial part of your job hunt.

As you create your professional presence online and apply through job portals,
recruiters will review each aspect of what you share. In most cases, hundreds
if not thousands of applications pour in for a given role and applications may
fall through the cracks. Alternatively, a recruiter may reach out to you
through a trusted connection or online networking site based on what they see
about you. This latter approach is where we'll be focusing our attention in
this section in order to better understand the mind of a recruiter so we can
put to practice some of those strategies in a reverse recruiting scenario.

## What is reverse recruiting?

Reverse recruiting is a term that we define as playing the role of a
recruiter for your job search. It involves growing a skill recruiting
teams call “sourcing”, which is traditionally the process of identifying
key characteristics for a role and reviewing \resumes or online profiles
to aggregate leads; in the case of reverse recruiting, you, as the job
seeker, are identifying key characteristics in a job opportunity or in a
company’s culture and using that list of qualified roles or company
names to identify recruiters, hiring managers, engineers, and personal
connections worth contacting.

Recruiters similarly filter a sourcing campaign by location, companies,
industry, keywords or education (to name a few). As a job seeker, a
shared location, industry, company or educational background can make a
tremendous difference when reaching out to a new professional
acquaintance by providing credibility or social proof. As you might
imagine, sourcing typically happens at the beginning of a search
process, though it's often repeated and refined as a search goes on. In
your case, it's worth taking a moment to get a snapshot of the typical
technical interview process in order to know how to most effectively
source out recruiting leads.

## Reviewing the interview process

Reverse recruiting is dependent on a robust understanding of a typical
technical interview process:

  **Stage 1**         **Stage 2**          **Stage 3**
  ------------------- -------------------- --------------
  Job Search Begins   Application Review   Phone Screen

  **Stage 4**      **Stage 5**        **Stage 6**      **Stage 7**
  ---------------- ------------------ ---------------- ----------------
  Tech Interview   Onsite Interview   Offer Extended   Offer Accepted

To begin with, it's important to take the time to define where you want to end
up. In your job search, you'll define the type of role, company, size, industry
and workplace values that seem worth pursuing.  Once defined, you can more
accurately tie those aspects to specific companies and then begin to search for
recruiters and other company points of contact.

This process may require two or three different points of contact depending on
factors like available contact information or mutual connections. It's best to
get creative and look into tools to help equip you with crucial information
(more on that in a second!). An important tip to keep in mind directly
pertaining to the interview process: try and balance out your outbounds with
your current supply of interviews.  In other words, despite key traction early
on in your job search process, keep on sending those outreach emails and
applications through to stage 4 and 5 (tech screens and onsites); it's much
better to have an interested recruiter or fall back company in the face of a
lost opportunity than having all eggs in a single basket and needing to start
your search from scratch.

## Reverse recruiting strategies

Now that you're clear on reverse recruiting and when it's called for,
let's discuss some concrete strategies to making this process more
successful.

### Sourcing tools

**Find helpful sourcing tools**. Here's a brief list of tools that can extend
your insight and influence when searching for key recruiting connections:

- [*LinkedIn premium* (premium.linkedin.com)](https://premium.linkedin.com/) -
  this tool provides greater insights on LinkedIn, along with outreach credits.

- [*Hiretual* (hiretual.com)](https://www.hiretual.com/) - this tool pulls
  emails for just about anyone via their LinkedIn or online profile.

- [*Yesware* (yesware.com)](https://www.yesware.com/) or [*Mixmax*
  (mixmax.com)](https://mixmax.com/) - this tool helps you track analytics on
  who, and when, folks are engaging with your outreach messages.

### Outreach

**Outreach is your best bet**. A few rules to keep in mind when reaching out to
new, potential professional acquaintances:

- *DMs work really well* - Twitter, LinkedIn, AngelList or otherwise, a brief
  intro message works well.

- *And so do public engaging public posts* - is your recruiter very active with
  posts or blogs? Go ahead and engage them where they're at with a comment,
  like, suggestion or share.

- *Make a brief and reasonable ask* - Avoid telling a lengthy story when
  connecting, especially when character limits hover around 140-300.  Be clear,
  concise and confident.

- *Try PDF attachments or links* - If possible, consider forwarding a \resume or
  relevant project link to help your case as a skilled and fitting candidate
  for a role.

- *Do your homework* - this may be the most important and relevant rule for
  engagement -- learn something about them and consider referencing it.


# Informational Interviewing

Here we'll discuss a fun, low-stress strategy to help your networking efforts:
informational interviewing. During this section we'll discuss: (1) **what is
informational interviewing** (2) and **strategies to connect with
interviewees.** Our aim here is open your eyes to another new approach to job
hunting and networking. Good luck!

## What is informational interviewing?

Informational interviewing is a separate approach to networking and job hunting
prioritizing first-hand insights and experiences from company employees as
opposed to just publicly available information. Specifically, an interested job
seeker can gain advice on the role in question, industry, and/or the company
culture of a potential new place of work. As you might imagine, this sort of
experience can be really valuable usually in one of three ways: first, as an
interested candidate, you can network your way into the job process with
potential advocates. Second, the opportunity to clarify whether or not this is
a potential fit just became tremendously easier *without* beginning
the interview process. Third, with insights gained, you can learn how to speak
the language of your interviewing team.

## Strategies to connect with interviewees

This section is two-fold. First, we'll cover strategies to find interviewees
and then we'll discuss ways to approach asking questions, so you can
effectively connect during the interview session. When seeking new
connections, you'll use similar strategies outlined in earlier sections. As a
quick refresher, try some of the following:

- *LinkedIn* - LinkedIn is *the* career hub where users expect to receive
  invitations or messages from professional acquaintances. The key here is
  having a good reason-- which informational interviewing definitely falls into
  that category. Try strategies of following the person and comment on posts;
  from there, you can naturally mention your connection and make an ask for a
  quick call.

- *Twitter* - Twitter really is a great tool to help get a pulse on developers
  or other tech employees who follow similar accounts or discuss areas you're
  interested in exploring. Search for keywords of the technology or markets you
  are in interested in, then engage with replies and retweets.

- *Company careers page* - Careers pages provide really valuable insights that
  a company is proud to publish for all potential new teammates to see.  Here's
  a great place to find insights and then define what isn’t listed that you
  might want to know.

- *Tech news* (i.e. Medium, Tech Crunch, company reports) - these posts tend to
  cite a team or author and are great opportunities to engage with relevant,
  time stamped material. You can engage via the publication or use social media
  to elevate it and then go from there.

Remember: when reaching out, make it clear you'd like to learn from them about
their experiences in a specific role or at a specific company. Doing this tends
to help the potential interviewee understand where you're coming from and
reaffirm the need to just show up versus prepare to do this, that and the other
on your behalf.

Now that you've gone about making connections, let's talk about a few ways to
ensure success when in the interview itself.

i. *Take the time to get to know them* - Unless someone hops on a call
saying, "hey our time is cut short", we highly recommend thanking them for
their time and asking mundane questions like, "how's your day" or "what have
you done today?" At minimum it's polite and best case scenario it opens the
space for unexpected dialogue.

ii. *Have a prepared list of questions* - The individual you're speaking with
has carved out time from their schedule to connect with you, likely with
nothing expected in return; the least you can do is prepare a list of 3 or 4
preferably-open ended questions. The added benefit is being able to compare
responses between companies with a controlled set of data-- useful in offer
negotiations.

iii. *Mind the time* - Fairly straight-forward point. For example, if you ask
for 15 minutes then keep an eye out for when the 12 or 13 minute mark comes and
acknowledge wanting to be respectful of their time. Perhaps pose one more
question and if they’re able to extend, they’ll say so; either way you're
ensuring being seen as a punctual and respectful person.

iv. *Thank them* - Lead with thanks for taking your call, end with thanks for
sharing their thoughts.

v. *Have an ask, especially if it's a network-related one* - Assuming the call
is going well, we encourage you to take a moment and make a key ask. At this
stage, a referral may be difficult but a networking ask might make more sense.
A good example is seeing whether or not they recommend you speak with anyone
else in the company or on their team.

----

You now have what it takes to reach out for informational interviews.It can be
hard to reach out of your comfort zone, but you can do it.  The only thing now
is to put this into practice!


# Email outreach templates

In this section we'll cover a handful of very helpful email outreach
templates. Having a few of these immediately available for plug-and-play
can really save you time during your job hunt. Looking forward, here are
the ones we've covered for you: (1) **General email outreach** (2)
**message within a 300 character limit** (3a) **message for when you've
already applied** (3b) **and an alternative post-application message**
(4) **message if you're replying to a recruiter who reached out to
you** and finally (5) **a message outlining an example when you might
withdraw your candidacy**.

## General email outreach

It's often an effective strategy to reach out to people at companies that you
have already applied to.

### Template 1

```
Hi [Name],

I'm a(n) [apprentice engineer] wrapping up an opportunity
with [your company or coding school]. Recently, I've
gotten in-process with [company] which is a dream
opportunity! I figured it'd be great to connect with
employees there to learn more about the culture and gain
some insight into life as an engineer at [company]!

Any chance we could connect for a 15 minute [call or
coffee] where I can ask a few quick questions?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Template 2


```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're well. I've came across your profile seeing
that you're at [company] doing [role]. Recently I've
gotten into the hiring process with [company], for [role]
and I'd love the chance to connect and gain a better
understanding of the [culture/technologies/team].

Any chance we could connect for a 15 minute [call or
coffee] where I can get your thoughts on [relevant aspect]?

## Replying to recruiters who messaged you

```
Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thanks so much for reaching out and sharing your
interest in [my experience]. I'd love the chance to
discuss [company/role] further and gain a better
sense about [the role/team/etc].

How's [insert availability, see below] for a chat?

Best,
[Name]
```

For example, for time availability, list something like:

- How's Monday or Wednesday? I have availability in the afternoon from
  2:30p-5:00p on each day.

- How's coffee later this week on Thursday or Friday? Happy to find a place
  near your offices sometime before 10am either day?


## Withdrawing Candidacy

Withdrawing candidacy seems like an odd thing to do but from time to time you
may find that a role doesn't end up being a fit, for one reason or another, and
you'd like to maintain a good connection with the company. In a situation like
that, it's better to communicate early and graciously. Here's a simple
structure worth following and that’s also outlined in the provided template:
(1) **Greeting and gratitude** (2)  **context** (and sharing your potentials
solution for the challenge, if applicable) (3) **reiterating thanks & open
communication** and (4)  **Close**. Check out the following template to see a
simple example.

*Reason examples:* taking a pause in the job search; exploring other full-time
engineering opportunities closer to home; reevaluating my career trajectory
