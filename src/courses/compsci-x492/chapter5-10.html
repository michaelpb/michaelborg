# Compensation and negotiation

This final section is for that exciting moment we've been waiting for: The
offer.

We've finally arrived at another one of the most anticipated aspects of the
entire outcomes curriculum: Compensation. We'll try and cover an overview.
During this section we'll discuss: (1) **How compensation looks in most tech companies**
and (2) **resources for comparing compensation** and finally (3) 
**how to go about negotiating compensation packages**.

## Discussing compensation in tech

Compensation is one of the most important components in a work opportunity.
Generally, the US national average annual salary for a *Software Developer* is
\$105K
^[Source: `bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.html`],
and according to one article, \$71K is the average salary for a bootcamp
graduate's first job.

In tech hub cities with high costs of living, these numbers are
typically higher. As an example, there were 40 national positions reported with
the title of "Junior Software Engineer" in 2019 in the H1B data. Salaries
ranged from 75k-96k in New York, and 90-120k in the SF Bay Area. This is
nearly double the much lower range given for the same title of 60-85k outside
of New York or California. ^[Source:
`h1bdata.info/index.php?year=2019&job=JUNIOR+SOFTWARE+ENGINEER`]

These salary figures do well on their own but also tend to include a whole host
of additional benefits in the entire compensation package, including: -
parental leave - tuition matching - commuting benefits - equity or company
stock - generous PTO leave - 401K matching - perks (i.e. snacks, food,
beverages) - health and dental care and more.

It pays to be aware of the various compensation factors because they can add an
extra \$10-\$20K to your overall compensation number. In addition to their
value, some of them, whether initially offered or not, are up for negotiation.
More on that in a moment but before we cover details on negotiation, it's
important to know how and where you can see insights on a company’s
compensation offering. For your reference, here’s a quick list of benefits most
regularly offered according to
[*Glassdoor*](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/top-20-employee-benefits-perks-for-2017/):

- Health Insurance
- Vacation & Paid Time Off
- Pension Plan
- 401k Plan
- Retirement Plan
- Dental Insurance
- Maternity & Paternity Leave
- Sick Days
- Vision Insurance
- Paid Holidays

A few others that may come up: tuition reimbursement, educational stipend,
perks (i.e. campus, games, meals, snacks), commuter benefits, or coworking
stipends for remote employees.


## Resources for comparing compensation

Though the tech industry has a ways to go on handling bias and equity in pay
across diversity lines, tech has helped to drastically improve visibility of
what compensation can look like through a number of really helpful tools.
Here’s a brief list:

- [*H1BData.info*](https://www.h1bdata.info/) - The US Department of Labor
  requires companies be transparent (and competitive) about compensation of
  H1B-visa hires, which gives you a great chance to see how much is *legally*
  considered market rate for different titles and positions, most of which are
  for tech companies.

- [*Payscale.com*](https://www.payscale.com/) - resource on comparing and
  researching company salaries and benefits and how you personally match up.

- [*Glassdoor.com*](http://glassdoor.com) - a company insights and research
  tool providing employee reviews, benefits list, industry trends and salary
  tool.

- [*Paysa.com*](https://www.paysa.com/) - known as a personalized career
  advisor, the tool helps clarify your worth, increase your value, all while
  discovering new jobs insights.

- [*KeyValues.com*](https://www.keyvalues.com/) - tool helping to clarify some
  of the core values and benefits offered on technical and engineering teams

- [*AngelList.co*](https://angel.co/) - one of the most comprehensive tools for
  searching specific startups actively hiring and seeing exactly what
  compensation packages they offer from cash, to equity, to benefits.

## Approaching negotiation

So, now you've gone through the majority of the interview process and an offer has
been extended. You might think that the next step is to merely accept the offer
but what if that wasn't the case? Actually, there's an often overlooked,
mid-step between offer extended and offer accepted: negotiation. As you saw
above, there are plenty of tools aimed at comparing, contrasting and providing
insights to better equip you with the proper knowledge to know where you stand
but applying that knowledge is another skill in and of itself. Let's talk about
some key steps to negotiating well:

1. *Do your research* - When you enter into a negotiating situation, be
prepared with the facts on the company, role, geographical salary averages, and
how they stack-up against industry peers.

2. *Stick to facts* - Know that you've done the homework, apply what you've
learned by mentioning, "the average web developer salary according to Glassdoor
or Paysa." This not only builds credibility but aligns your range more
accurately with insights from others in the industry.

3. *Have a range* - Giving a salary range inherently provides space for
negotiation and shows you to be amenable. A helpful example to illustrate would
be providing a \$85K-95K range, where you hope to negotiate \$90K. By having a
\$85K lower end, you've anchored the range close enough to potentially
negotiate up and can consider leveraging certain additional benefits like
number of vacation days or an education stipend to close the \$5K gap.

4. *Practice, practice, practice* - If you can, try and ask a friend or peer
to role play a negotiation phone call or interview situation where you can
practice what you'll say and how push back might feel. In role playing, a
script laying out your asks and supporting reasons can be very helpful.

5. *Be agreeable* - Keep in mind that this company has sent you an offer so
they have faith in your abilities as a new teammate. That said, seek to assume
positive intent even if the negotiation doesn't seem to go exactly as you
hoped. A helpful phrase might be reiterating "finding a middle ground" or
"finding a solution that works best for the company and both you and your
family." These phrases sound thoughtful and help clarify that you’re aiming for
a win-win scenario.

6. *Have conversations live; follow up in writing* - Lastly, always aim to have
negotiations live over the phone, or in-person if it's requested. This allows
for a fuller, more embodied conversation where you can read a sense of the
hiring manager's thoughts and receptivity to what you've shared. During a chat,
if you come to an agreed point, re-share it in the form of a question to
confirm alignment and communicate that you'll share a brief following-up in
writing to make sure everyone’s on the same page.

**Finally, a bit of encouragement:** If you feel like *imposter syndrome* or
self-doubt is getting the better of you at this phase, repeat to yourself: *You
deserve more.* As an engineer, designer, or any other role discussed in this
guide, you are creating extremely valuable pieces of software that will be used
to garner millions of dollars in investment, or sold to corporations for
contracts in the hundreds or tens of thousands of dollars, or sold to thousands
of consumers earning millions and millions of dollars. It's your labor that's
creating this product. You are creating massive, massive amounts of value, and
chances are your salary is quite a bit less than the actual value you are
adding. Your role in the company is making it all happen. *You deserve more!*
