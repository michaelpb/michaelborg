# Application process

Let's dive into the most anticipated aspects of the entire process:
Interviewing. In this section we'll (1) examine a typical application process (2)
look at the different types of pre-interview challenges you might face (3) talk
about general tips for screening interviews (4) go through general tips for the
on-site interviews (5) dive into common interview questions and how to answer
them, and finally (6) talk about problem solving for on-site "whiteboarding"
interviews.

While it's intimidating for your entire job hunt process to seemingly hang in
the balance in a few crucial key hours of inspection, with these tips from
veteran interviewers (and interviewees) you can go into the interview process
with confidence!

> **Tip:** Cheat-sheets are super useful for online or phone-based interviews.

## Big picture

For hiring for entry-level positions, many tech companies have the following
process:

1. **Application** --- You submit your \resume & application

2. **Challenge(s)** --- For entry-level positions, it's common to first
encounter either an *automated algorithm quiz* (a Hacker Rank-style coding
challenge, with automated grading), or a *take-home challenge* (a
"mini-project" to do in a given framework, and submit for human review via a
GitHub link or emailed zip file).

3. **Screen(s)** --- Phone screen interviews can take the form of *tech
screens* (done by an engineer), or behavioral or *recruiter screens* (typically done by recruiter or HR).

4. **Video Interviews / On-site(s)** --- Finally, the big day! Full video interviews
and/or on-sites can range from an hour to an entire day of interviews. They can be
behavioral, technical, or a mixture of both. Often, there can be two rounds, as the pool of candidates is
further reduced.

5. **Offer**

## Big picture tips

* **Go-to language:** Pick a programming language as your go-to.  Ultimately choose the one that you are
  most comfortable with. If you are mostly applying to front-end developer positions,
  JavaScript might be a better choice. If you are applying to mostly backend or data-related positions, or
  expect a lot of data-structures questions, we'd recommend Python, as it's widely known, has a
  terse syntax that is easy to write by hand, along with powerful built-in language
  constructs such *sets* that come in handy in a lot of interview-style questions.

* **Research the interviewer:** Always look at the title and/or LinkedIn of the
  person interviewing you. Are they an engineer? Be ready for potentially tough
  technical questions. Anything else? Probably going to be behavioral or
  screening questions.

* **Don't give up!** Give everything your best, and even if you don't succeed
  submit it anyway. Be ready to fail many times before you succeed.^[I've
  coached so many students who think they absolutely bomb a set of interviews
  or challenges, only to find out soon after that they actually knocked the
  socks off the interviewer. The reverse can be true sometimes also. As an
  interviewee, it can be very hard to know how well you are doing.]



## Pre-interview check-list

1. **Interview type known** -- will it involve coding?

2. **Company & product researched** --- know the company, and have some ideas on
their product.

3. **Interviewer researched** --- you know their name & position.

4. **Questions prepared** --- you have a question or two for the interviewer.

5. *For coding interviews:* --- **Brain "warmed up"** --- do challenges right up to the time you have to
    leave for the interview. You want to start "in the zone".

6. *For behavioral interviews:* --- **Mock-interview work-sheet "warmed up"** --- warm up by going through the
    mock-interview worksheet.

7. *For behavioral and/or engineering screening interviews:*  **Technical story prepared** --- have a technical
    story picked out and ready to be told.
