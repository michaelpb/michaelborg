title: Personal Narrative Worksheet
breadcrumb: chapter2
list: true
---




As you develop your "career persona" --- the "\resume version of you" that
you'll be "selling" to potential employers --- a vital component of this is a
*narrative*.  A narrative is a story. A story has a beginning, middle, and
end. A story has some tension, some success, and perhaps some strong adversity
that demonstrate strength and growth.

Keep on reading for a worksheet on how to build your own narrative.

## How to use

This tool is designed to help equip you to respond to the inevitable interview
(or even pre-interview question) that comes in some form of: *"Walk me through
your \resumeNoSpace"* or *"What have you done"*

**Successfully executing this sheet will**:

-   Provide a well thought out and compelling answer in interviews

-   Help you to gain you an advocate in your interviewer or recruiter

-   Allow you to set the tone and direction of your interview

**By helping you identify and articulate**:

-   A storyline about your vocational journey (*using only positive bridges
    between transitions)*

-   Highlighting significant successes (*meeting, exceeding goals, and creating
    results*)

-   Seeking to alleviate any potential red flags (*time gaps in employment,
    frequent job switches etc.*)

-   Clearly addressing how your skills and experience can add value to *this*
    company & role

**Allowing you to clearly articulate how your skills and experience can
add value to *this* company & role by**:

-   Reflecting on your past experiences

-   Creating the bridges that connect your background from one stage to the
    next

# Reflection Interview Prompts

## How to use

*This tool is designed to help equip you to answer specific questions
related to your work experience.*

**Successfully executing this sheet will**:

-   Provide a well thought out and compelling answer in interviews

-   Help you to share experiences that you see as relevant to the role
    at-hand

-   Allow you to set the tone and direction of your interview

**By helping you identify and articulate**:

-   Specifics related to your projects and work

-   Highlighting significant successes, ways of thinking and problem solving
    skills

-   While seeking to engage and articulate “failed attempts” and what you
    learned through them

**You will be**:

-   Reflecting on your past experiences

-   Digging deep into the process of your tasks for skills, qualities, and
    processes

**Your response should**:

-   Flow chronologically or with the STAR format (see below)

It's important to clearly communicate when asked specifics about your
work experience. In an interview setting, ambiguity tends to harm not
help your chance of growth. The following prompts are geared at helping
you highlight qualities and skills that are strengths to you and
value-adds to your interviewer’s team. Some examples include: attention
to detail, critical thinking, leadership, ambition, consistency,
reliability, communication, and teamwork.

The intent here is to have you answer each question in a way you’d
verbally or naturally respond. A great tip to remembering is structuring
your response as Situation, Task, Action, Result (or S.T.A.R) format.
