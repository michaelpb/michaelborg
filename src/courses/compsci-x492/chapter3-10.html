# Networking

Chances are, your next position is going to come from someone you know right
now, or someone you will meet in the next few months. It's very common to hear
statistics such as: "80% of jobs never end up getting posted anywhere", or "referrals
from existing employees make up 40% percent of new hires, but only 7% of
applicants" (giving you an almost 6x statistical advantage). I've found it hard
to validate these exact statistics from a more trusted source than blog posts;
however, from anecdotal experience, it holds up completely, as often people who make
big career changes quickly, do so through connections.

In this section, we're going to cover the basics of networking, both on and
offline. By reading the following you’ll have a better sense of how to begin
strategizing approaches to building new connections at MeetUps, hackathons or
on LinkedIn. As you read, we'll clarify content related to: (1) taking stock of
where you are (2) getting started with networking (3) then cover networking
in-person (4) and online.

## Where are you now?

Let's start with taking stock of where you are currently in your career.

* If you do not have a coding job right now, networking and building your
  narrative networking becomes ten times more important. A big change in your
  career is always hard, and the bigger the change the more persistence it will
  take.  Prepare yourself now: You *will* have to step way outside your comfort
  zone!

* Do you not have a coding job, but you already at a tech company or a company
  that has a software development department? ***Always pursue internal
  transitions first.*** You might not get much of a pay-raise (after all, they
  know your current salary, which means they can drive a much harder bargain
  than you can), but your foot is already in the door. Even if you don't like your
  current company, your first goal might be getting your title changed, while your
  next goal might be finding a company you like. In 6 months to a year after
  your title change, start applying on the down-low and see if you start getting
  more success. Also, often companies and managers are supportive of your new
  skill change, so if you think your manager or coworkers might be helpful, chat with them
  to see if you can start doing coding tasks on the side. Most companies need more coding
  "muscle" than many other positions, so if you prove your worth they'd welcome you gradually
  switching your duties at the company, and eventually your job title.

* Do you have friends or acquaintances at tech companies?  Send out feelers
  right now: Make sure *all* your friends knows you are job hunting.^[If you
  are nervous socially about this, don't be! Hiring typically takes place
  through connections, and you aren't asking them to vouch for you, just to
  keep an eye out and maybe hand over your \resumeNoSpace. It can be introduced
  as simply as mentioning in person you've been job hunting, "oh I've been
  meaning to ask you, do there happen to be any open positions where you
  are working? None? Well let me know if something pops up. It's tough out
  there!" Or: "hey, I've been applying to so many full stack jobs these days.
  Is your company hiring at all? Really? Cool, do you know who I could reach
  out to? I don't know if you have the time but if you get the chance could you put
  us in touch?"] Also, reach out to friends, colleagues, and acquaintances.^[If
  you're not sure how to phrase this, consider the following format: "Hey,
  how's it going?  Been a while!  We'll have to *[grab coffee / do lunch / grab
  drinks / etc]* again some time. So as you may know I've been doing this
  *[certificate program / career development course / etc]*. I really want *[to get
  out of my current job / get into software development / etc]* so I'm just
  asking around to see if there are any open positions at *[company name]* -- I
  didn't see much on the site, and it seems like a pretty awesome place to
  work!"] Just the simple act of their handing in a \resume or forwarding your
  email to a decision-maker could put you on a *much* shorter list!


## Getting started with Networking

Networking is easier than you might think. It's not all business cards
and superfluous conversation but can also be an opportunity to reconnect
with old peers, friends, work acquaintances and mutual-admirers of a
certain technology. If you've never been in a formal networking setting,
don't worry. A couple easy places to find some include:
[*Eventbrite*](https://www.eventbrite.com/),
[*Meetup*](https://www.meetup.com/),
[*Facebook*](https://www.facebook.com/). Searching for a tech or affinity group
as well as relevant hashtags can lead to a number of new events that are well
suited to meeting others.  Something to note: a significant number of events
are free but for the ones that cost, mentioning that you're a student (if that
applies) or from an underrepresented group can often help offset costs. Another
great strategy to lowering costs is volunteering! Usually volunteering involves
needing to set up or greet people; both are a great way to naturally meet
people as part of the work and also mitigate some awkwardness all while getting
access to a cool event.

## Networking In-Person

Despite having the skills you're about to learn, networking can seem
intimidating. Especially when you're actually standing at an event, in
front of an actual person and thinking intensely about what might be
said without sounding *too* awkward. It's understandable, we've all been
there. In the spirit of making things a bit less painful and, dare I
say, enjoyable the following are few tips to think about when attempting
to make a connection:

- **Know your setting & audience** - Take time to do your research to see
    where you're headed and establish who’s attending or which company is
    hosting.  Most events have a guest list available with the ability to do
    some light social media looking to better identify people of interest or
    folks with mutual connections. Those extra few minutes are worth checking
    when you're making small talk.

- **Shoot for groups but don't avoid individuals** - It's worth saying
    individuals can be hit or miss in a networking setting mainly because
    there’s only one of them. Groups allow for more than one entry point where
    you might resonate with the second person present if the first one falls
    flat. Wondering how to open? First, greet everyone and introduce yourself.
    After intro’s, a reliable first question is as simple as, "So what
    specifically brings you here tonight?" This question comes across as
    natural, open-ended question, not too deep and fair game to answer as
    briefly or extensively as one might want.

    - A real value add, and ability to establish yourself as a solid
    networker, is the ability to begin facilitating connections based off
    the responses of other people. For instance, mentioning how Janice, whom
    you met earlier near the hor d’orves, might want to talk with that other
    person because of *X-thing* in common you just learned.


- **Notice nearby individuals; invite them in** - Now hopefully
    you're in a group and found your tribe for the evening. Despite the comfort
    of the group, continue to be somewhat aware of your settings.  Maybe you
    notice someone else seeking to get involved in the conversation you’re at;
    if so, invite them in. A natural way to invite the nearby individual in is
    by turning toward them and asking: "what do you think about *[insert
    question being discussed]*?" In addition to being seen as a thoughtful and
    inclusive conversationalist, this also potentially serves as a helpful out
    when you're looking to move on from the conversation. How so? Simple, you
    can potentially integrate this new person, get the new chat going and then
    gracefully bow out to try again in another setting.



## Networking Online

Online networking might seem easier, since you have a screen and time to think
between every message but it comes with its own unique challenges to navigate.
Essentially, you're relegated to one dimension of self (*i.e. no in-person
presence*) to convey emotion or other added benefits of being face to face with
someone else. Another unique factor includes character or typing limits.
Despite these limitations, networking online is far reaching and there are five
keys that might help your efforts bear fruit.

- **Find a useful angle** - Similar to guest lists, LinkedIn serves as
    a personal data mining tool for professionals, lending useful insights on
    how to request someone's time or connection. (i.e. mutual previous company,
    approaching your connection as a "newer developer," or requesting coffee.)

- **Think, "Ask"** - After leveraging your angle, develop the "ask."
    It needs to be posed in light of a few specific things:

    - *Your specific invitation vs. non specific invite*. Don’t come to a
    conversation unprepared. it reflects poorly on you as a professional and
    makes it seem like you don’t value someone's time.

    - *Considering your most ideal desired results*. What is the best case
    scenario? Establish that reality, acknowledge it and then move to the next
    criteria to establish whether or not you can run with it as an actual *ask*.

    - *Finally, establishing whether your ideal ask is reasonable* (as these
    two attributes are not necessarily mutually exclusive). This will vary case
    by case but depends on factors such as time allotment, medium of connection
    and weighing one outcome versus another.

- **Mitigate the awkwardness** - Mitigating awkwardness is all about
    taking the time to look at what you have in common with someone without
    forcing the likelihood of your connection on them. This act serves as the
    process of building up to your "ask" by preemptively acknowledging the
    distance between x & y (x being you and y being them). A natural place to
    attempt this is after sending your connection via LinkedIn or right after a
    email introduction (or warm handoff from a professional acquaintance). You
    can engage with any of the following example next steps:
    - "Hey I noticed we share a mutual passion for..."
    - "You seem to have a lot to say about *\[insert topic\]*, would you be
      open to sharing thoughts on..."
    - "Thanks for making a connection, I’m wondering if you’d be open to
      referring..." *Oh and lastly,*
    - Use the power of your “ask” as an introduction.

- **Reframing** - Another helpful tip is taking the time to reframe
    the recipient of your connection/email:

    - *Integrate something unique* into an your outreach email.

    - *Lead with a compliment* (skills, language, achievement) without
    sounding cheesy or corny. Perhaps mention a recent article on their company
    or the team's new product growth. Especially do this if you’re aspiring to
    achieve similar goals and want to know how they did it.

    - *Put yourself in their shoes*. If you were a Sr. SWE and a Junior SWE
    reached out for a connection to ask for 15 minutes of their time or a half
    hour over coffee near your office, what would you say? More than likely,
    yes, assuming you had the bandwidth. That’s likely how your recipient feels
    as well.

- **Positioning yourself** - Really key: Figuring out how to position
    yourself as someone your recipient is sure they can assist. People don't
    want to do *everything* for others but they're inclined to help someone
    along the way. That said, make it clear what your value add is. You can
    share about the work you've done in company projects or take another angel
    to highlight a similar language, identity, group/activity affinity (i.e.
    React, fellow UC Davis grad or avid fellow cyclist).


Every situation and contact will be different, but these should function as
some initial strategies to keep in mind when building new relationships.
