# The Screening Stage




## What is an interviewing screen

Interviewing screens are a part of every single technical interviewing process.
This stage helps companies filter through their "top of funnel" or applicant
pool to ensure the company's hiring team is efficiently allocating bandwidth to
the most promising applicants. Companies go about this process differently
using coding screens, video conversations, generic problem solving questions or
pair programming as a means of teasing out skills. But before companies come to
this phase of technical screening, it's helpful to know how a company decided
to invite a given candidate for a technical screen --- cue the initial (or
recruiter) screen.^[See Atlassian's approach: [atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/coding-challenges`](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/coding-challenges)]

Initial interviewing screens are also known as recruiter screens because
recruiters tend to be the next step following an outreach attempt, referral or
application. At this phase, recruiters are doing a "get to know you" phone call
to get a sense of your story, communication abilities, culture fit and perhaps
key accomplishments that help provide the recruiter with the confidence needed
to pass you onto the next stage in the hiring process. Successful candidates
will have a succinct career journey thatâ€™s consistent with the given resume
along with a few concrete stories related to project or career success. The
better your story can align with the role in question or the recruiter's
experience, the higher likelihood the recruiter will feel confident about
passing on your application.

Once you pass the initial screen, a technical screen tends to follow. This
phase is geared at filtering out your basic coding skills. Depending on the
company or role needs, technical screens can be pretty rigorous or simply a
technical bar to see if you really can code. Either way, this phase is one that
might be the basis for subsequent conversation in the interview process so try
your best to prepare and don't be afraid to ask your recruiter what to expect
in a technical challenge.

## Strategies for success in an interviewing screen

Interviewing is a solo sport but it doesn't mean there aren't resources and
avenues for support that don't exist. We hope to point you to a few of them
that you might find helpful:

- [*Glassdoor (glassdoor.com)*](http://glassdoor.com) - though not a technical
  hub, reviews on this site can help provide insight into what to expect when
  interviewing with a given company.

- [*Whiteboard.io (whiteboard.io)*](https://www.whiteboard.io/) - a technical
  interview prep program providing feedback, support and community.

- [*Stack exchange*](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/) - an online
  community where you can provide experiences, thoughts and interviewing
  questions on a forum.


- *The company's career site* - more and more companies are sharing how they
  differentiate themselves in an interview process and what to expect.
  Definitely worth a look for each company!


Given these insights, be sure to take time to explore and see what may work
best for your success.



## Screening challenges

If you are applying for an **engineering role**, it's possible the first thing you
will face is some sort of online test or challenge. While they can be required for
a variety of positions, it's most common to encounter these for entry-level to
mid-level positions, such as those open to new graduates.

### Automated tests

*Automated online coding tests* are how 100s of applicants can be weeded-out so
that only dozens remain.  They'll often send a link to a third-party site or a
custom site, such as Hacker Rank. Often, on that site is a button that will
"reveal" the challenge and give you a time-limit for giving an answer or
solving it in a programming language of your choice.

#### Tips


- Get your cheatsheets handy, have Google tabs open, be as prepared as
  possible. This is a race against the clock to assemble the best possible
  solutions to each challenge.

- As with in-person interviews, the only way to "lose" fully is by giving up
  or not trying. Partial credit is good too, so attempt everything.

- Start "in the zone": Warm up your brain before you click the "Start" button
  by doing similar online challenges.


## Take-home challenges

Another option for weeding out candidates for entry-level and intermediate
level positions --- sometimes used in the place of or in conjunction to the
automated quizzes --- is a take-home coding challenge. This is often done in a
specified framework (such as React.js or Django). They often say "take as much
time as you want", but clearly you shouldn't for a few reasons: (1) you are
competing against other applicants, and (2) your time is valuable, and you need
time for applying for other positions, too.

These challenges can be very frustrating due to how time consuming they are,
and are especially asymmetric in time consumption. The company can give out
dozens of these, spending possibly a total of 100s of hours of applicants time,
only to spend an hour looking over them and out of that choose one or a few
applicants to move forward. That being said, don't skip it: Responsible
companies won't give this challenge to a candidate they aren't serious about.

### Tips

* Set a time-limit. "Clock in" and "clock out" as though you were contracting.
  Your time-limit should be based on your free-time and a judgment of both how
  serious you think the company is taking your candidacy, and how much you like
  this position.
    - Don't do it all at once --- if, for example, you decide that it's worth
      it to spend 8 hours on one of these, space it out over a few days.

* Code quality is paramount: Write good, clean, commented code.
    - Attempt to write "self-documenting code"
    - Sprinkle in comments. There is *definitely* such a thing as too many
      comments: Comments should be added only where the code itself is
      difficult or impossible to decipher. That said, for a take-home
      challenge, if you aren't sure what's the right amount, it's probably
      better to err (slightly) on the side of too many comments.
    - Possibly document all public function signatures --- this depends on
      whatever is standard for the language or framework you are using

* Code neatness is extremely important too: Use a "linter" (and/or automatic
  code formatter) to ensure your code follows the indentation, whitespace,
  and naming conventions of the language you are using.

* Ask questions! If the requirements aren't clear, clarify them before you
  start.
