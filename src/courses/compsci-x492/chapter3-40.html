## Outeach Toolkits




Now that you're clear on reverse recruiting and when it's called for,
let's discuss some concrete strategies to making this process more
successful.

### Outreach

**Outreach is your best bet**. A few rules to keep in mind when reaching out to
new, potential professional acquaintances:

- *DMs work really well* - Twitter, LinkedIn, AngelList or otherwise, a brief
  intro message works well.

- *And so do public engaging public posts* - is your recruiter very active with
  posts or blogs? Go ahead and engage them where they're at with a comment,
  like, suggestion or share.

- *Make a brief and reasonable ask* - Avoid telling a lengthy story when
  connecting, especially when character limits hover around 140-300.  Be clear,
  concise and confident.

- *Try PDF attachments or links* - In the case of a recruiter, if possible,
  consider forwarding a \resume or relevant project link to help your case as
  a skilled and fitting candidate for a role.

- *Do your homework* - this may be the most important and relevant rule for
  engagement -- learn something about them and consider referencing it.



### Reverse recruiting and sourcing tools

**Find helpful sourcing tools**. Here's a brief list of tools that can extend
your insight and influence when searching for key recruiting connections:

- [*LinkedIn premium* (premium.linkedin.com)](https://premium.linkedin.com/) -
  this tool provides greater insights on LinkedIn, along with outreach credits.

- [*Hiretual* (hiretual.com)](https://www.hiretual.com/) - this tool pulls
  emails for just about anyone via their LinkedIn or online profile.

- [*Yesware* (yesware.com)](https://www.yesware.com/) or [*Mixmax*
  (mixmax.com)](https://mixmax.com/) - this tool helps you track analytics on
  who, and when, folks are engaging with your outreach messages.



## Email outreach templates

In this section we'll cover a handful of very helpful email outreach
templates. Having a few of these immediately available for plug-and-play
can really save you time during your job hunt. Looking forward, here are
the ones we've covered for you: (1) **General email outreach** (2)
**message within a 300 character limit** (3a) **message for when you've
already applied** (3b) **and an alternative post-application message**
(4) **message if you're replying to a recruiter who reached out to
you** and finally (5) **a message outlining an example when you might
withdraw your candidacy**.

## General email outreach


```
Hi [Name],

While exploring [company], your profile popped up/stood out
as [relevant observation].

I'm a newer [role title, i.e. software engineer] who just wrapped up a
[list technologies i.e. full-stack] project building
[project name] and I’m interested in connecting with a team
like [company].

That said, it would be great to learn more about
[team/company/culture]. Any chance we could take 5 or 10
minutes to talk more?

Best,
[Name]
```


## 300 character limit - i.e. LinkedIn

```
Hi [Name]

I'm a [front-end developer] wrapping up an apprenticeship
opportunity at [coding school name], exploring [industry
i.e.  "biotech" companies] like [i.e.  "23 and Me"].
I'd love to connect & pick your brain on [company culture
or engineering].

Any chance you're free for a 15 min chat?

Cheers,
[Name]
```


## If you've already applied

It's often an effective strategy to reach out to people at companies that you
have already applied to.

### Template 1

```
Hi [Name],

I'm a(n) [apprentice engineer] wrapping up an opportunity
with [your company or coding school]. Recently, I've
gotten in-process with [company] which is a dream
opportunity! I figured it'd be great to connect with
employees there to learn more about the culture and gain
some insight into life as an engineer at [company]!

Any chance we could connect for a 15 minute [call or
coffee] where I can ask a few quick questions?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Template 2


```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're well. I've came across your profile seeing
that you're at [company] doing [role]. Recently I've
gotten into the hiring process with [company], for [role]
and I'd love the chance to connect and gain a better
understanding of the [culture/technologies/team].

Any chance we could connect for a 15 minute [call or
coffee] where I can get your thoughts on [relevant aspect]?
```


## Replying to recruiters who messaged you

```
Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thanks so much for reaching out and sharing your
interest in [my experience]. I'd love the chance to
discuss [company/role] further and gain a better
sense about [the role/team/etc].

How's [insert availability, see below] for a chat?

Best,
[Name]
```

For example, for time availability, list something like:

- How's Monday or Wednesday? I have availability in the afternoon from
  2:30p-5:00p on each day.

- How's coffee later this week on Thursday or Friday? Happy to find a place
  near your offices sometime before 10am either day?


## Withdrawing Candidacy

Withdrawing candidacy seems like an odd thing to do but from time to time you
may find that a role doesn't end up being a fit, for one reason or another, and
you'd like to maintain a good connection with the company. In a situation like
that, it's better to communicate early and graciously. Here's a simple
structure worth following and that’s also outlined in the provided template:
(1) **Greeting and gratitude** (2)  **context** (and sharing your potentials
solution for the challenge, if applicable) (3) **reiterating thanks & open
communication** and (4)  **Close**. Check out the following template to see a
simple example.

*Reason examples:* taking a pause in the job search; exploring other full-time
engineering opportunities closer to home; reevaluating my career trajectory


```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to send an update regarding my candidacy for
[company and role] interviewing process. Though I
appreciate the time spent with you and your team up during
this process, I regretfully have decided to withdraw my
candidacy.

For context, I am [list reason for withdrawal, see below]

That said, I really enjoyed [insert compliment] and I'd
love to keep an open line of communication down the road.
Thank you again for your time.

Best,
[Name]
