In this section, we're going to start with the basics of the technology
industry and what certain terms mean when considering a new role or company.
We'll clarify content related to: (1) company size (2) sector / industry (3)
roles (4) employment types (5) aspects of compensation packages along with
some helpful thoughts attached to each of them. Finally, we'll have some space
to (6) create your own job-seeking profiles, synthesizing all that we've
learned. Good luck!

## Company Size

**1-10** - very early-stage startup. Great opportunity to find a role and make
immediate and big impact. Note that work might tend to be more ambiguous or
cross-functional and hours can be pretty extensive; traditionally, be ready for
less work-life harmony in these size companies. Also, be careful with these if
you are very new: It's likely you will not get as much engineering mentorship
(or supervision) if the team is very small or you end up working directly with
the CEO. Salary can also largely vary in companies this size.^[Equity may be
more significant as an early stage incentive, which --- statistically speaking
--- often does not pay off.]

**11-50** - forming startup. Just past the early, early, stage size.  Might
just be establishing general company culture, product market fit and beginning
of general company departments. This sized company is likely around a Series A
round of funding with an opportunity to gain meaningful equity and make impact.
Likely a bit more of a sure bet than its early-staged counterpart.

**51-200** - mid-sized company. Huge growth phase startup-to-mid-sized company.
They've likely hit stride (product-market fit) and might have a recognizable
name. Great time to jump in and ride a key growth period while also working in
a large enough company to where infrastructure is pretty set. Role likely has
far less ambiguity than last two stages.

**201-1,000** - mid-to-large sized company with solid financial backing,
potentially unicorn-status and holding some "pre-IPO" buzz. These staged
companies likely have strong mentoring cultures.

**1,000+** - there's a wide range of companies here, including private and
publicly traded companies with multiple offices and well-established teams.
These organizations have very established infrastructure.

## Company Sector

**FinTech (Payment)** - Short for Financial tech. This is a pretty wide
net that includes payment apps like Stripe or Venmo to financial
wellbeing platforms like Credit Karma, Earnest or Wealthfront.

**EdTech** - Short for Education tech. Another widely defined category
including platforms like Seesaw, Udemy, Quizlet or even tech
non-profits like Girls Who Code and CODE2040.

**CleanTech (Environmental or Green)** - Short for clean energy or
environmental tech. This pace includes solar, electric vehicle and other
sustainability minded operations like Tesla or CivicSolar.

**Shared Economy** - Companies democratizing opportunity or access like
Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft.

**HealthTech** - Companies in the health and wellbeing space including
Fitbit, ClassPass, HeadSpace or Omada Health.

**eCommerce (tech)** - Online transaction companies like Amazon,
Shopify, eBay and Poshmark.

**BioTech** - Technology based on Biology or life studies related work
like 23andMe and Ancestry.

**Food Tech** - innovating the way we encounter food: Mealpal or DoorDash.

**Gaming** - This sector includes eSports, mobile, and online/PC gaming
companies like Blizzard, Twitch, Smash.gg, and Popdog.^[Note: Many game
development companies are notoriously terrible to their employees, so do your
research!]

**Hardware, IoT, Wearables** - Beats, Nest, Ring and Fitbit all count in
this space.

**Legal** - think Clerky, LawPal and Stripe Atlas all providing
streamlined access to legal services.

**Lifestyle** - aimed at increasing quality of life for users/clients,
think Hinge, Popsugar or Bumble.

**Travel** - travel based platforms that bridge gap between the many
verticals of travel (lodging, experiences, packages, flights) including
Expensify, Uplift, Airbnb or NoirBnB.

**HR & Workforce Mgmt.** - software for businesses helping increase
productivity and handle business infrastructure needs such as Workday,
Lever, Zenefits or Gusto.

**Music** - companies that are centered on leveraging music in some
manner and innovating on traditional avenues of growth or musical artist
empowerment like Tidal, Spotify or Pandora.

## Company Roles

A quick note on how you'll potentially categorize yourself as a
developer.

### Typical web positions

* **Front End Engineer** - Developing the code that powers the interactions on
  a website. Taking in PNG specs and building HTML/CSS pixel-perfect
  representations. Familiarity with using REST APIs. Use of JavaScript,
  CSS, ReactJS, AngularJS, EmberJS, Vue.js, TypeScript, etc.

* **Back End Engineer** - Building the backend server-side code that powers a
  web-app. Building backend APIs and using MVC frameworks for database work.
  Use of Python, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Java, Go, SQL, NoSQL etc.

* **Full Stack Engineer** - a generalist, comfortable with both front-end and
  back-end


### More specialized engineering roles


* **Software Engineer**, **Software Developer** - This title simply means that
  you code for a living. It may be used in lieu of any of the more specialized
  positions (e.g. Frontend Developer, Mobile Developer).

* **Test Engineer**, **Software Engineer in Test**, **QA Engineer** -
  Familiarity with full-stack, strong with testing frameworks and testing
  methodologies. Will be maintaining and building testing infrastructure.

* **Mobile Engineer**, **Mobile Developer** - Swift, React Native, Android Java, iOS

* **DevOps** - Linux system administration, Bash, Docker, and some back-end
  languages

* **Sales Engineer**, **Solutions Engineer** - Skills same as other engineering
  roles, plus some people skills or sales experience.  Usually builds custom
  integrations or features to support clients or win over new clients

* **Data Scientist** -  Strong Python skills and familiarity with related data
  science tools (`numpy`, `pandas`, `Jupyter`). Less common, but still popular,
  are R and Matlab. Candidates often have expertise in a relevant field of
  science or engineering, or expertise in computer vision or Machine
  Learning.^[Machine Learning is not as hard to learn as you might think (or as
  fun or as cool --- the day-to-day involves tediously tweaking coefficients
  and re-running statistical software on training data) although a strong math
  background is highly useful.]


* **Game Developer** - Write the code that powers video games! Skills in C++,
  C#, proprietary frameworks like Unreal or Unity, and strong familiarity with
  video-games.^[Note: Coding video-games professionally can be lot different
  than other positions, both in terms of respect for you as worker (there's
  less), and in terms of development process. Generally, speed and volume of
  development is valued over quality. Good software development practice, such
  as automated testing is nearly non-existent, and some shops may even have
  shaky use of version control.]


### Coding-light positions


* **Web Developer** - This title can mean a few things, some of which do a lot
  more coding than others^[And positions with fewer coding skill requirements
  naturally may have a pay cut compared to very similar Front End Engineer
  role], but often implies using and maintaining HTML / CSS themes and templates,
  familiarity with using CMS frameworks such as WordPress, and web publishing
  concepts such as SEO^[Search Engine Optimization --- designing websites and
  content to perform well on Google.]

* **Web Designer**, **Designer** - Photoshop, Illustrator, HIG, eye for graphic
  design. Depending on the role, HTML & CSS skills might be required.

* **Development Support Engineer** - Supports engineers and customers in a
  variety of ways. Similar code knowledge-set to a backend engineering
  position, though typically a heavier focus on SQL and may require customer
  communication. Day-to-day typically does not commit code or work on
  enhancements.

* **QA Specialist**, **QA Analyst** - Typically involves manual testing.
  Attention for detail, sometimes requires coding typically in SQL or E2E, and
  testing frameworks like Selenium or Puppeteer.

* **Product Manager** - Wireframing tools, knowledge of SCRUM and agile,
  instinct for user interfaces and building wireframes, skilled in cross-team
  communication, some coding knowledge of SQL usually required, and broad
  understanding of coding and debugging process, Git, full stack roles,
  understanding APIs, and core HTML / CSS concepts common.

* **Data Analyst** - Comfortability with popular analytics software like
  Tableau, Excel. Solid statistical knowledge, and possibly light scripting
  knowledge such as with Python is common or required.

## Employment Types

It's good to familiarize yourself with the various types of employment. The
thing to keep in mind here is that just because you're working full-time (i.e.
40+ hours a week) doesn't necessarily mean you're a "full time employee" of a
company. Look at the following to learn more:

**Contract/ Temp (to Hire)/ Contingent** - this is a short term, predetermined
work placement with a company, often project-oriented.  Some contract hires
have the opportunity to "convert" to full-time employee with the company;
others gain time extensions or simple expire.  While contracts are a great way
to gain experience in a variety of situations, usually with greater
flexibility, drawbacks may include not having access to full-range company
benefits or equity available to a FTE hire.

**FTE** - Full time employee, which is to say a regular, benefitted employee of
the company as opposed to the company being the client as it is in a
contract-based placement. This is often an indefinite or at-will employment
with the benefit of having full or unhindered access to internal resources and
opportunities in a manner distinct to a contractor. Typically not eligible for
overtime pay, like a contractor, FTE roles include benefits offered by the
company.

**Intern** - Short term, 3-12 month placement at a company often in an
interim, junior-like phase.

**Apprentice** - Similar to an internship, an apprenticeship is a short
term, 3-12 month track to help open pathways for individuals usually
coming from a non-traditional educational background (*i.e. bootcamps,
self-taught, workforce re-entrance*). Programs are usually created as a
means of growing company diversity and inclusion.

## Compensation Packages

A quick note on the potential benefits and drawbacks of certain employment
opportunities.

**Compensation Package** - comp packages can include (*though not limited to*):
salary, hourly rate, stipend, health/ vision/ dental coverage, tuition
reimbursement, educational or personal well-being funds, time-off (*PTO,
parental, caregiving allowances*) housing, meals or other perks.

**Ownership / equity** - represents one's percentage of ownership interest in a
given company. The amount and type vary depending on the stage and status of
the company. This could be worth something, or literal pennies, and it's not
always easy to tell, so always take compensation in this form with a grain of
salt (or maybe an entire bag of salt!)

**Benefits** - when referred to, normally include health, dental, and vision
coverage.

**Time-off** - this can include PTO (paid time off), days to volunteer, sick
days, personal days, parental or bereavement leave. Some policies are fixed,
accrued, required-minimum or open. Pro-Tip: "Unlimited vacation" really means
no vacation.
