# Interview questions & tips

To prepare for an interview, it's often good to have a "mock-interview" with
yourself. While it may seem strange, preparing for certain questions can
improve your confidence when you actually get asked them.

## Mock interview worksheet

1. For each question, answer on a separate sheet of paper --- or type up
answers, or answer verbally into a recording, so you can review your answer.
Imagine you are replying to each of several interviewers while interviewing
with an engineer at your favorite social network. Remember to answer
differently based on the person interviewing you!

2. When you are done, look at the "tips" at the end. "Grade" yourself based on
these tips.

3. With these tips in mind, try re-answering all the questions, or revising
your existing answer.

4. Practice saying out-loud your "second-draft" answers. It's important not to
memorize anything and sound rehearsed: Memorized answers that sound "too good"
could look bad in an interview. Instead, practice conversationally chatting
about it. Think about how you might "go into" these answers from other
questions that may not be covered here.

### Repeat mock interviews

**If you have time, try for as many other combinations as you can:**^[E.g.
Backend Engineer at Music sharing site. Product manager at real-estate site.
etc]

* Interviewers: *Backend Engineer*, *Designer*, *HR manager*, *Product manager*

* Companies: *Popular social media network*, *Real-estate listings website*,
  *Enterprise HR software company*, *Music sharing site*

## Tips

These are the "answers" or tips for these common interview questions.

* **Describe a technical challenge and how you overcame it.** --- This question
  is listed first because it's very often asked. Building a good *technical
  challenge narrative* is crucial to answering this question. See the
  "Technical challenge narrative" guide further on for in-depth tips on this
  one.

* **Can you tell me a bit about what you were doing at [your previous
  position]?** --- This can be answered in a similar way to the previews
  question, except you should be much "bigger picture." Instead of attempting
  to impress by describing a single story, you are giving the birds-eye view of
  all the things you've worked on, but ready to dive in about any particular
  detail. Sometimes this question is the lead-up to the previous question.
  Most of the advice contained in the "technical challenge narrative" below
  applies to this too.

* **Why did you choose *[technology / framework]* for the project *[previous
  project or position]*?** --- This is to ensure you picked languages and
  frameworks based on what solves the task, not based on what is "cool", or
  simply based on the fact that it's all you know (which could be true, also).
  Good answers will explain the strengths of the framework or language you
  chose in conjunction to the project you worked on, possibly a teamwork
  element or the decision making process you used with your team, and possibly
  mention others considered and why you ultimately discarded them.


* **Do you use our product? If so, what do you like about it? Dislike about
  it?** --- For consumer facing products, it helps to actually try out the
  product before the interview. It's okay to say you aren't super familiar, but
  even just messing around with it for just an hour shows that you care about
  the company and is an important part of pre-interview research.


* **At our company, we are always facing challenges scaling to accomidate new
  users. What approaches or considerations might you think about along these
  lines?** --- Consider who is asking this question: Backend Engineers, DevOps,
  or full stack folks are probably interested in hearing you talk about scaling
  from a server perspective. Frontend Engineers, Designers, and Product
  Managers might want you to address graphical / UX limitations (e.g. having to
  add a search feature because the amount of content is much bigger). Business
  or sales might want to hear some basic business scaling issues: Who would you
  have to hire to allow such an expansion?


* **If you could only pick one, what new feature would you add to our
  website?** --- Similar to the "have you used our product" question, this one
  gets asked a lot. Always go into an interview prepared to answer this
  question. For engineers interviewers, feel free to dive into speculation of
  how you might develop it, or what limitations might be in play. For sales,
  marketing, or more business-oriented interviewers ("suits"), motivate it with
  how that might improve the product from their perspective (e.g. increase
  "conversion rate" or decrease drop-off).

* **For that feature you mentioned, how would you test it to make sure it
  worked?** -- Even for non-QA positions, they'll want you to have some basic
  testing sensibilities. Think about normal usage, edge cases or corner cases,
  about unusual usage of large or small number of users using it, and so on. If
  the person asking is an engineer, feel free to talk about automated testing
  frameworks, unit tests, end-to-end tests, and so on. *You will always "win
  points" by saying that you're a big fan of automated testing.*


## Technical challenge narrative 


* **The question:** Can you describe a time you faced a technical challenge and
  how you overcame it?

* **The goal:** You want to prove that you'd be a valuable addition to the
  team. The interviewer will be evaluating your answer, picturing you as a
  member of their team, thinking if based on your answer you'd be good at
  contributing and solving the sort of problems they are facing or will be
  facing.

* A good story will involve the following elements:
    1. A tough or intriguing problem
    2. Teamwork and communication
    3. Your process of coming up with a solution (in conjunction with the team)
    4. Final success, and positive results

* A *great* story will involve one or more of the following:
    - Causing the interviewer to be engaged, and curious to learn more
      (earnestly asking questions)
    - Solving a problem in a similar domain of the company (e.g. if it's a
      retail company, perhaps do a about credit card payment
    - Generally being "outside" the knowledge of the interviewer --- e.g. if
      you describe struggling for a time with a problem that the interviewer
      solves daily, that's less impressive, but if you describe struggling with a
      problem that the interviewer has never even faced, that is a lot more
      interesting.
    - Solving a problem the interviewer's team is currently strugggling with.
      This is hitting the jackpot, since it's essentially saying: "Hey, hire me
      and I'll solve that issue you are facing right now."


### Technical challenge tips

* **Think of unique challenges.** No one wants to hear about how you messed up
  that Git merge, since it happens to everyone. Think of times you wrestled
  down buggy or poorly documented APIs. Think of problems that strayed way
  outside the collective knowledge of tutorials or Stack Overflow.

* **Prepare a couple stories.** Emphasize different technologies or types of
  challenges, and pick one based on which company you are chatting with.

* **Take note of who is asking.** Engineers want to hear how you applied your
  smarts to fix the problem. "Suits" want to hear about business results (e.g.
  increased clicks or conversions, increased value, didn't waste time). Both
  want to hear solid communication.

* **Go deep as you can.** Don't give a surface level explanation. Part of the
  purpose of this question is to ensure you aren't faking the fact you know the
  stuff on your resume. Be specific instead of being vague.

* **It's okay to give a "Hollywood" version.** Much like Hollywood biographies
  "clean up" the story to make an easier narrative, It's okay to smooth over
  your story, or maybe weave together a couple of challenges you faced that in
  fact were distinct, to make the story easier to tell and demonstrate your
  candidacy.  Of course never lie about your story or anything --- both for
  ethical reasons, and because the interviewer will probably notice --- but
  they aren't asking for every boring detail.

## More questions

You may also want to repeat this style of practice, with the a standard assortment
of behavioral interview questions:

- **Why do you want to work here?** --- Good reasons might include passion
  about the industry, company culture, excitement about the tech stack used,
  curiosity about the problems they are facing.

- **Out of all the other candidates, why should we hire you?** --- Speak to the
  particular combination of skills and life experience that makes you, you!

- **What are your biggest strengths?** --- Pick one (or two max) strengths to
  emphasize. (E.g. Creative solutions to tough problems, perseverence, hard
  worker, leadership skills, agile communicator etc)

- **What are your biggest weaknesses?** --- Resist the temptation of answering
  "working too hard". Instead pick a real weakness, one that isn't a complete
  show-stopper, but shows honesty and ability for self-critique. Also, share
  what you are doing to improve in this respect. (E.g. "I sometimes don't
  clarify requirements well enough before starting work. I'm really trying to
  get better at this, however.")

- **Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10 years?** --- A good way to answer
  this is simply think of a more advanced version of the position you are
  applying to. That might involve managerial duties, or it might involve a more
  specialized position based on what you are interested in (e.g. Networking Engineer, 
  ML, Data Science, Lead Product Designer, etc.)

- **Tell me about a time you disagreed with a decision. What did you do?** ---
  The goal of this question is to see if you can "gracefully" admit you are
  wrong, or go along with a majority opinion. Tell a story from your work or
  project experience about a time where you maybe were on the wrong track but
  took criticism well.

- **What questions do you have for me?** --- *Always* come prepared with a few
  questions. If you are caught off guard, then just ask a few usual ones: "How
  long have you worked here? What was the biggest surprise you had about
  working here?" etc.
