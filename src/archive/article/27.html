<h1 class="title">Releasing Sawdust: Mini-post-mortem</h1>
<section class="post-content">
<p>A couple months ago <a href="../p/12b0a44e-b576-4eed-bd27-2a4e6124d960/index.html">I wrote about realizing "enough was enough" with my feature-creeped game</a>. Along with working on other projects, I spent some time in the next couple months cutting out features and polishing existing ones, all working under a "late-May" deadline.</p>
<p>Now, my new (much smaller) vision for Sawdust is feature complete... and ready to roll in a few days! I'm not 100% happy with how it turned out... but it is <em>something</em>, and it definitely was a great learning experience.</p>
<h2 id="lessonlearnedalwaysprototypeafewgamesorvariationsatatime">Lesson learned: Always prototype a few games or variations at a time</h2>
<p>While I read <a href="http://gamesfromwithin.com/prototyping-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong">various advice on game prototyping</a>, and did build a Sawdust prototype, I failed to see the warning signs that the <em>prototype itself</em> has to be actually pretty fun. I thought the core concept seemed solid, so I'd add features to make it fun. Like software, "more features" does not mean better... one simple concept that is fun is better</p>
<p>It's completely possible to complete an <em>actually fun</em> prototype <a href="https://ldjam.com/">without a huge time investment</a>. Now I feel I need to complete at least one or two of these before I should invest time in one of them. Otherwise, you could dump days into gameplay, and the game will never quite feel like a game. While I feel that Sawdust did eventually turn into a game (only at the end, really), it was a meandering journey that could have been a lot shorter if I forced myself under time constraints to discover some kernel of "funness" at the heart of the concept.</p>
<h2 id="lessonlearnedkeepinmindwhatcouldbereused">Lesson learned: Keep in mind what could be re-used</h2>
<p>This is one I mostly did right. A lot of stuff I wrote for sawdust I wrote as <a href="../godot-packages/index.html">re-usable packages</a>. I also wrote about 30 minutes of a fun soundtrack which no longer fits Sawdust's smaller scope, so that can easily be reused for my next game project.</p>
<p>I did however make a lot of content -- notably a partially finished storyline and puzzle campaign -- that won't fit into the smaller-scoped Sawdust. If I ever get the urge, I might wrap that up into a bigger game that more closely reflects the original vision.</p>
