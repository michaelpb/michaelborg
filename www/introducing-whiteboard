<h1 class="title">Introducing: Whiteboard</h1>
<section class="post-content">
<p>I made a cool thing: Whiteboard is slideshow application for teaching programming. It embeds a code editor, terminal, and web browser into a slide-show like interface to eliminate context-switches and dead-space, while enabling more content content to be set-up ahead of time. It's great for guiding code-heavy classroom lectures, tutorials, workshops, and webinars.</p>

<p>I initially developed it for my own teaching at UC-Berkeley Extensions, but I realized it might be useful for others, as well. Essentially the goal is to make a "slide-show" app that transforms the concept of a "slide" into an <em>activity</em>, as opposed to static content. Thus, the slide deck functions as a sequential collection of activities, each of which can consist of one or more sub-applications.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>As of <code>v0.0.27</code> (which is the first known critical bug-free and feature complete build), the following "sub-applications" (or panes) are available:</p>
<h4 id="codeeditor">Code editor</h4>
<ul>
<li>Save tab layouts of multiple files for your presentations</li>
<li>Based on ACE Editor</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting for 100+ languages</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="webbrowser">Web Browser</h4>
<ul>
<li>Have fully-functioning websites embedded in your slides</li>
<li>Uses Chromium-based WebView, for full support for all sites no matter how complex</li>
<li>Use to demonstrate websites as you build them</li>
<li>Useful for webinar tutorials</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="terminal">Terminal</h4>
<ul>
<li>Save a terminal to start at a working directory</li>
<li>Useful for running example code as you write it</li>
<li>Full color and cursor support, e.g. vim works</li>
<li>Based on the same library (xterm.js) as VSCode</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="markdown">Markdown</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easily add rich text with Markdown</li>
<li>Useful for content-only slides</li>
<li>Can be mixed with other panes to add instructions or context</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="saveandeditslidedecks">Save and edit slide decks</h4>
<ul>
<li>By saving preset combinations of the above activities, craft a slide deck that guides the</li>
<li>Slides can be added, deleted, and re-arranged</li>
<li>Supports 3 layouts and several theme presets</li>
<li>Decks can be saved, loaded, or shared</li>
<li>Saves to a plain-text format, for easy manual tweaking</li>
</ul>
