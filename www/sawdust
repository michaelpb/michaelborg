<p>Drag and drop blocks onto the board to rack up points and advance to the next level in this addictive new spin on the classic game of tangrams.</p>
<p>Two different modes cater to both casual and hardcore-puzzler game styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Zen mode allows you to take your time to use the best strategy to conquer each board</p></li>
<li><p>Arcade mode forces you to think quick to conquer every level before your sawdust runs out</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Mess up? Hit "try again" and give it another go. I'll warn you, you might get addicted!</p>
<p>Psst: Want a spoiler? Get far enough, and you'll unlock ADVANCED MODE... get even farther, and unlock IRON MODE: a fun/addictive/frustrating experience.... no powerups, and no room for mistakes!</p>
<p>The game features: <br />
- 20 distinct power levels which offer dozens of different power ups
- Increasingly difficult board levels that offer endless challenge
- Original music
- No in-game transactions, it's just you, your wits, and a bit of luck!</p>
<p>Are you up to the challenge?</p>
